<h1>The OR4 maturity framework</h1>
<p>The maturity framework and self-assessment tool can be used by a group of stakeholders in an institution to assess maturity in the implementation of recognition and reward for open research, to support internal discussion and planning, and to measure ongoing progress.</p>
<p>The maturity framework describes four levels of maturity across nine action areas:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>No Action</strong>: There is currently no action in this area</li>
<li><strong>Emerging</strong>: There is some developing activity in this area, but it is relatively unsystematic and lacking in strong strategic direction</li>
<li><strong>Evolving</strong>: Activity is developing in a systematic and strategic fashion in this area and is demonstrating progress against defined objectives</li>
<li><strong>Sustained</strong>: Activity has implemented its main strategic objectives and is consolidating and embedding on a business-as-usual basis.</li>
</ul>
