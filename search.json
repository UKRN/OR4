    "text": "Main areas of activity\n\nIncluding open research objectives in research planning\nGiven the dominance of the research publication as the global currency of research, institutional planning objectives will remain largely focused on publications and will only practically engage with a greater diversity of outputs as the result of a sustained effort. The same planning framework will influence the definition of objectives for institutional research units (Schools, Departments, research divisions, research groups) and for individuals.\nResearch planning at institutional, unit and individual level has the power to define what is important to the institution, and to influence research practice. It can drive adoption and use of open research practices, and ensure that open research outputs have greater visibility within institutional systems that support the planning, management and ultimately the assessment of research. But planning strategy will need to be aligned and supported at all levels of the institution. There are likely to be challenges in ensuring consistency where planning activities are organised and managed at different levels by different stakeholders.\nResearch planning will be informed by research assessment expectations. Institutional-level research planning will be influenced by the eligibility and assessment criteria of the REF and the requirements of funders among other factors. These expectations will in turn inform planning and objectives for intra-institutional research units and for individual researchers. There will be policies and processes associated with these activities, which must be updated to take account of requirements and expectations related to recognition and reward for open research. Changes will need to be supported by communications with research leaders and managers, provision of guidance, and professional services support. Training may also need to be provided. Further information is provided in the Guidance and training section.\nAs it becomes easier to cite and provide access to a wider range of open research outputs by means of trustworthy research infrastructure and persistent identifiers, and to quantify aspects of their use by means of reliable indicators, they will acquire greater visibility within institutional systems. This will make it easier to specify measurable objectives related to them and to build institutional planning activities and services around them. In this way, open research objectives could be cascaded through the institution. For example:\n\nat an institutional level, research planning could set open research KPIs/objectives, e.g. to increase numbers of datasets deposited in repositories and cited from research publications. Information could be extracted from data availability statements associated with publications, although systems and workflows will be required to capture and analyse this information.\nsupport for open research is an aspect of the ‘People, Culture and Environment’ element of the REF, and the ‘Contribution to Knowledge and Understanding’ element will enable institutions to evidence a greater diversity of research activities and outputs.1 REF planning can anticipate these requirements and work with the institution’s open research leadership and support to begin developing its strategy for addressing them;\nresearch units could be asked to define open research objectives appropriate to the disciplines and types of research they cover, to work with their researchers to increase relevant activities and outputs, and to report progress upwards. Dedicated professional services support could be provided to boost capacity, for example through tailored training sessions or workshops, and one-to-one expert support for specific practices, such as pre-registration, data sharing and software publishing. Objectives could also be set to build open research capacity in strategic areas through recruitment and promotion;\nwithin the wider frame of institutional and local open research objectives, individual research planning objectives can be tailored to the researcher’s specific context and aligned to open research criteria for promotion. This might involve development of individual research plans focusing on the acquisition of open research skills or the production and communication of open research outputs in addition to publications.\n\nThese requirements may inform design and use of systems for collecting and managing open research information, as discussed in the Support, systems and processes guide.",

This may be focused on open access research publishing and research data management and sharing. Support may need to define a broader open research remit in accordance with strategic objectives to develop open research culture and practice, and additional staffing/resources may be required or desirable to meet a growing need for training and expert support across a variety of open research practices in addition to publishing and data sharing, e.g. research software engineering and pre-registration, and to provide discipline-specific expertise in open research methods. The senior strategic lead for open research and any relevant stakeholder group should work with professional services to develop strategic plans including business cases for investment where needed, expansion of roles to capture additional open research requirements, creation of partnership models and collaborative relationships, and more effective application of institutional expertise. What is achievable will depend on the avaialbility of resources in the institution.\nThere is likely also to be some existing support for the generation and validation of research metrics, as part of institutional research planning, management and assessment activities, and in response to the needs of individual researchers. Demand for these services can be expected to grow, with greater demand to handle enquiries, provide research metrics reports and researcher profiles, assess/validate metrics on request, and in other ways support those involved in research assessment activities, for example as part of recruitment or promotion panels. Monitoring and reporting on compliance with policy may require additional support. There will also be a need for institutions to work with their academic community to develop responsible assessment processes and provide guidance and training in responsible research assessment.\nThere is work ongoing in the sector to develop indicators and metrics related to open research practices,1 and this may be an area where there will be a need for new responsibilities related to their collection and management. Other new demands may also be established, including training for panels or guidance on job descriptions and narrative CVs.\nColleagues providing support for processes such as recruitment, probation, promotion and performance and development review may need to integrate some support for responsible research assessment, and recognition of open research within that. Additional requirements may be absorbed into existing responsibilities, processes and systems to a large extent. For example, HR staff may need to check job advertisements and job descriptions against requirements; or if there is a requirement for members of recruitment and promotion panels to take training on responsible research assessment, training logs may need to be created and checked. HR colleagues will also need to be sufficiently informed to handle enquiries that may require signposting of relevant policy or information, or making a referral to expert support, for example as provided by open research support colleagues.\n\n\n\nSystems and processes may need to be modified or developed in support of changes to research assessment policies and procedures. For example:\n\nForms may need to be updated, e.g. to include instructions and guidance on citation of open research activities and outputs other than publications where relevant;\nTemplates may need to be updated to include standard texts related to responsible research assessment and open research expectations for use in job advertisements;\nResearch assessment workflows and checklists may need to be developed, to help staff undertake research assessment appropriately. This could include open research-related checks;\nNew systems, or developments to existing systems, and related processes may to be required to collect and process open research information. This is dealt with in more detail below.\n\n\n\n\nDevelopments in research infrastructure are making it easier to identify and collect outputs and data related to individuals and organisations. Information about open research activities and outputs can be used to support institutional planning and development, to manage and report against compliance requirements, and to inform researcher assessments. Institutions may need to adapt existing systems or invest in new solutions and integrate them with their existing research information infrastructure.\nKey developments in research infrastructure directly relevant to capturing and processing information about open research activities and outputs include increasing use of:\n\ntrustworthy repositories to publish and preserve different kinds of outputs;\npersistent identifiers (PIDS) such as DOIs and ORCiDs to enable accurate citation, discovery and linking of entities (e.g. linking of researchers and institutions to research outputs, and linking between research outputs, such as publications and datasets);\nthe CRediT Contributor Roles Taxonomy in output metadata, facilitating more accurate description of individual contributions to research activities and outputs.\n\nPublishers and other providers of research infrastructure services are developing research information and analytics products to enable the aggregation, management and analysis of data about open research outputs (including data, code, protocols, pre-registrations, preprints) and attributes (e.g. CRediT roles) from across a distributed research infrastructure of publisher platforms, repositories, preprint servers, registries, broker services and research information systems. Examples of products that support open research analytics include Dimensions from Digital Science, Elsevier’s Data Monitor, and OpenAIRE Monitor. The PLOS Open Science Indicators initiative, developed in collaboration with the AI company Dataseer, is working to develop and pilot institution-level reporting functionality.2\nOne important aspect for institutions to consider is the openness of research information. It is a principle of responsible research assessment that those being evaluated should be able to verify the data and analysis used to evaluate them. Yet much of the information by which research practices might be monitored and evaluated is held in closed systems. Proprietary commercial products such as Web of Science and Scopus, which underpin much of the publication-based analytics used in researcher assessment activities, lack transparency. This is something that has been of concern to the research assessment reform movement, with DORA, the Leiden Manifesto and CoARA all taking positions in support of open research information. The Barcelona Declaration on Open Research Information, published in 2024, sums up the concerns of the sector and enumerates a set of commitments that signatories can sign up to.\nSome institutions are developing their own workflows and services to collect and manage open research information. For example, the University of Manchester Library has developed an Open Research Tracker, which leverages integrations with its CRIS, CrossRef, and the Scholarcy AI platform to collate and integrate information about publications and data. Its development roadmap anticipates further integrations, including with its data repository, ORCiD, the Open Science Framework, and protocols.io, and the capability to collect data relating to a wider range of output types, including pre-registrations, methodologies, and research software. The University is planning to release its software under an Open Source licence, so that other institutions can make use of it.",

Institutions may need to adapt existing systems or invest in new solutions and integrate them with their existing research information infrastructure.\nKey developments in research infrastructure directly relevant to capturing and processing information about open research activities and outputs include increasing use of:\n\ntrustworthy repositories to publish and preserve different kinds of outputs;\npersistent identifiers (PIDS) such as DOIs and ORCiDs to enable accurate citation, discovery and linking of entities (e.g. linking of researchers and institutions to research outputs, and linking between research outputs, such as publications and datasets);\nthe CRediT Contributor Roles Taxonomy in output metadata, facilitating more accurate description of individual contributions to research activities and outputs.\n\nPublishers and other providers of research infrastructure services are developing research information and analytics products to enable the aggregation, management and analysis of data about open research outputs (including data, code, protocols, pre-registrations, preprints) and attributes (e.g. CRediT roles) from across a distributed research infrastructure of publisher platforms, repositories, preprint servers, registries, broker services and research information systems. Examples of products that support open research analytics include Dimensions from Digital Science, Elsevier’s Data Monitor, and OpenAIRE Monitor. The PLOS Open Science Indicators initiative, developed in collaboration with the AI company Dataseer, is working to develop and pilot institution-level reporting functionality.2\nOne important aspect for institutions to consider is the openness of research information. It is a principle of responsible research assessment that those being evaluated should be able to verify the data and analysis used to evaluate them. Yet much of the information by which research practices might be monitored and evaluated is held in closed systems. Proprietary commercial products such as Web of Science and Scopus, which underpin much of the publication-based analytics used in researcher assessment activities, lack transparency. This is something that has been of concern to the research assessment reform movement, with DORA, the Leiden Manifesto and CoARA all taking positions in support of open research information. The Barcelona Declaration on Open Research Information, published in 2024, sums up the concerns of the sector and enumerates a set of commitments that signatories can sign up to.\nSome institutions are developing their own workflows and services to collect and manage open research information. For example, the University of Manchester Library has developed an Open Research Tracker, which leverages integrations with its CRIS, CrossRef, and the Scholarcy AI platform to collate and integrate information about publications and data. Its development roadmap anticipates further integrations, including with its data repository, ORCiD, the Open Science Framework, and protocols.io, and the capability to collect data relating to a wider range of output types, including pre-registrations, methodologies, and research software. The University is planning to release its software under an Open Source licence, so that other institutions can make use of it.",

    "text": "See Implementation guide section: Policy and procedure\n\n\nThe University of Bristol is a research-intensive University, with over 29,000 students and employing approximately 9,000 staff. The University has a reputation for academic excellence and delivering world-leading research.\n\n\n\nA review of promotion and progression in 2017 included recommendations to review the promotion criteria for Associate Professor and Professor, which resulted in a new Academic Promotions Framework (APF) that launched in the 2020-2021 academic year. The APF looks to nurture individual and team excellence through clear descriptions of the full range of contributions and achievements that are valued by our institution. This exercise resulted in the specific inclusion of open research practices as an example of the contributions recognised by the APF.\nThe APF provides four categories for applicants for promotion to demonstrate their achievements against: (1) Research (2) Education (3) Engagement & Impact (4) Leadership & Citizenship. Each has different criteria intended to cover the range of expectations and experiences across academic pathways, and the diversity of staff that work at the University.\nThe Research category captures what it takes to build our position as one of the world’s leading research-intensive universities. Criterion R-1 (Research Outputs) goes beyond just publications and other formal ways of presenting research findings, and explicitly includes open research outputs.\nFor an individual to be recognised for demonstrating open research outputs within the R-1 criterion, they must evidence: ‘Producing open research outputs as appropriate by adopting good practice in, for example, sharing data and code, sharing materials, sharing digital outputs, publishing preprints and pre-registering study protocols’.\n\n\n\nAs a founding member of UKRN, and lead organisation on the UKRN Open Research Programme, we recognised the need to demonstrate sectoral leadership to incentivise uptake of open research practices. Through the Research Improvement Group (now Research Culture Committee), chaired by Professor Marcus Munafò as UKRN Institutional Lead for Bristol, we liaised with those undertaking work on the development of a new Academic Promotions Framework.\nThe aim of the Academic Promotions Framework programme was to create an academic career path that is challenging, rewarding and inclusive, and which enables all academic staff to have the opportunity to reach their full potential.\nIn order to achieve this, the University needed to recognise and reward the full range of contributions and achievements that are valued by the institution in ways that are transparent, accessible and sustainable. At the same time, our role in UKRN and our long history of sectoral leadership on open research practices meant that the Academic Promotion Framework programme presented an opportunity to embed incentives to promote uptake of these practices.\n\n\n\nThe Deputy Vice Chancellor and Provost was the senior sponsor of the Academic Promotion Framework programme, and chaired a Programme Board made up of senior stakeholders across the institution. Having a senior sponsor for the change was imperative to promote the strategic importance of creating the APF, and in navigating resistance to the change in the process.\nThe facilitators and Programme Managers of the change were the Academic Staff Development team, operating as part of the Academic Career Development Programme. The University’s commitment to external agreements such as DORA and the Concordat on Open Research Data also established a basis for including open research practices: ‘the production of open research data should be acknowledged formally as a legitimate output of the research process and should be recognised as such by employers… in contributing to an individual’s professional profile in relation to promotion’.\nProfessor Marcus Munafò worked with members of the Programme Board and Academic Staff Development team to argue for the inclusion of open research practices in the Academic Promotions Framework, and developing the corresponding wording.\nThose involved in the Programme Board were:\n\nDeputy Vice-Chancellor and Provost\nChief People Officer\nDirector of People and Organisational Development\nUCU Representatives\nAcademic Representatives (Research, Educational and Leadership Improvement)\nEarly Career Academic Representatives (Post-Doctoral Researcher and Lecturer)\nStaff Engagement Group Representative\nHead of Academic Staff Development\n\nAs the concept and practical resources for the Academic Promotions Framework evolved, there was also significant consultation across the institution for feedback. This included (but was not limited to) the following:\n\nHeads of School across all Faculties\nDeans and Pro Vice Chancellors across all Faculties.\nSchool Managers across all Faculties\nHR Business Partnering and Central HR Operations teams\nEDI Team\nReward and Recognition Teams from Organisational Development\nPeople Development\nTrade Unions\n\nFor the Academic Promotions Framework to be adopted into practice, other changes were required, such as establishing a Faculty Promotions Committee for each Faculty.\nIn particular, narrative writing workshops for building a promotion case within the Academic Promotions Framework were set up to help applicants understand the criteria and how to demonstrate that these had been met. This provided staff with the means and understanding for them to be recognised and rewarded appropriately, via a promotions case, both in general and specifically in relation to the inclusion of open research practices in their case if appropriate.\nIn the development of the Academic Promotion Framework, its concept was shared within the consultation groups (see above). This was via focus groups and bespoke presentations, led by the Academic Career Development Programme.\nThe finalised versions of the Academic Promotions Framework are available to both internal colleagues and externally to the wider public via the University of Bristol website. As the APF versions evolved, this too was updated. The links to the Academic Promotions Framework, and associated guidance documentation were shared via internal bulletins, and by relevant line managers, School and Faculty staff and Heads of HR Business Partnering, as their colleagues prepared their promotion cases.\nThe Academic Promotions Framework launched in time for the 2020/2021 promotions cycle for Associate Professor/Professor grades, and extended to Research/Teaching Associates through to Senior Lecturer/Senior Research Fellow grades in time for the 2021/2022 academic year. Shortly after the launch of the APF, the opportunity to use it to embed incentives for open research practices was recognised and pursued. The open research elements of the Academic Promotions Framework were promoted via the Research Improvement Group and through related activities such as the Open Research Prize.\n\n\n\nThere was a need to make allowances for adjustments in Schools to support individual and discipline-specific requirements and approaches. This was particularly true for open research practices, which are currently adopted to different degrees across disciplines. Similarly, career stage was a consideration, as earlier-career researchers tend to be more familiar with open research practices than senior researchers.\nPromotion is a topic which intersects several others across the institution. For effective changes to be made to the benefit of individuals and the institutional strategy, there must be meaningful consultation with all those who would be potentially impacted.\nThe iterations that result from this consultation are made most effective when driven by a governance structure with clear accountability and responsibility of roles, working towards clearly defined objectives and timelines.\nThese issues are particularly salient in the context of open research practices, which are variably understood and engaged with across, for example, disciplines and career stage, meaning that the criteria needed to be sufficiently broad and flexible to accommodate this.\n\n\n\n\nSenior Sponsorship is essential, and to provide direction and demonstrate institutional commitment.\nClear governance structures for decision making are required, including a clear Responsibility, Accountability, Consulted and Informed (RACI) model for the delivery of the project.\nThe inclusion of open research practices requires consideration of differences across, for example, disciplines and career stages, so that the relevant criteria are sufficiently broad and flexible.\nIt is essential to have a full Equity Diversity and Inclusion impact assessment conducted and continuously reviewed throughout the project, and post-implementation. This will ensure representation across our full diversity of colleagues, and allow the impact of the process to be proactively assessed via reporting in areas such as: gender, ethnicity, contract status and career pathway.\n\n\n\n\nUniversity of Bristol Academic Promotions Framework\n© University of Bristol.

It can enable a group of stakeholders to establish a baseline, identify and focus on the target level of maturity in each action area, plan the means by which this target can be attained, and in due course measure progress.\nThe materials can be adapted and used according to need. We recommend a self-assessment exercise be built around a workshop for a group of stakeholders. A workshop will be most effective if it is established on the basis of a shared understanding of the open research and research assessment reform agendas and the rationale for implementing recognition and reward for open research. The introduction to the implementation guide, Why recognise and reward open research practice?, could be read by participants in preparation for the workshop. The executive summary provides a briefer high-level overview of the context and rationale for action. The nine sections of the guide mapped to the maturity framework can be used to develop a more in-depth understanding of the action areas and to identify key progress actions that can inform the action plan developed in the workshop.\n\n\n\n\nIdentify the group of stakeholders who will participate in the exercise, and the person who will facilitate the session. It may help all members of the group to participate on an equal footing if the facilitator is someone independent from the group.\nAsk each member of the stakeholder group to:\n\nRead the executive summary and/or Why recognise and reward open research practice? and, optionally, spend some time browsing the implementation guide. This is to ensure all members of the group have a shared understanding and sense of purpose around recognition and reward for open research.\n\nUndertake an independent assessment of institutional maturity using the maturity framework as a reference. The related sections of the guide can be used to explore each action area in greater depth and identify relevant progress actions. The self-assessment tool can be used to document maturity assessments for each of the nine action areas, along with comments and notes on the progress actions the institution should take.\n\n\n\n\nWe recommend the workshop is no longer than 2 hours. The workshop can be used to:\n\nagree on the current level of maturity in each of the action areas;\nidentify the level of maturity you would like to reach over a given timescale (e.g. 2-3 years later);\nidentify progress actions necessary to attain the target maturity level, and organise these into the framework for a strategic plan.\n\nThe workshop could follow a four-stage format:\n\nIntroduction. A set of slides is provided which can be used to set the scene and explain to the group why incorporating recognition and reward for open research into researcher assessment is important. The slides can be freely adapted.\nBreakout groups/discussion 1:\n\ndiscuss individual institutional assessments for each of the nine areas;\ncompare notes;\nagree current and target maturity levels for each of the nine areas.\n\nBreakout groups/discussion 2:\n\nidentify priorities and areas for change;\nidentify and organise progress actions to achieve previously agreed target maturity levels for each of the sections.\n\nWrap-up:\n\nsummarise the discussions;\nset next steps and allocate actions.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWrite up the summary of the exercise.\nDevelop a draft action plan.\nSchedule a date to re-run the assessment, e.g. at project conclusion or a milestone stage identified in the plan, in order that progress can be measured and celebrated, and a plan for further action agreed if required.",

The self-assessment tool can be used to document maturity assessments for each of the nine action areas, along with comments and notes on the progress actions the institution should take.\n\n\n\n\nWe recommend the workshop is no longer than 2 hours. The workshop can be used to:\n\nagree on the current level of maturity in each of the action areas;\nidentify the level of maturity you would like to reach over a given timescale (e.g. 2-3 years later);\nidentify progress actions necessary to attain the target maturity level, and organise these into the framework for a strategic plan.\n\nThe workshop could follow a four-stage format:\n\nIntroduction. A set of slides is provided which can be used to set the scene and explain to the group why incorporating recognition and reward for open research into researcher assessment is important. The slides can be freely adapted.\nBreakout groups/discussion 1:\n\ndiscuss individual institutional assessments for each of the nine areas;\ncompare notes;\nagree current and target maturity levels for each of the nine areas.\n\nBreakout groups/discussion 2:\n\nidentify priorities and areas for change;\nidentify and organise progress actions to achieve previously agreed target maturity levels for each of the sections.\n\nWrap-up:\n\nsummarise the discussions;\nset next steps and allocate actions.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWrite up the summary of the exercise.\nDevelop a draft action plan.\nSchedule a date to re-run the assessment, e.g. at project conclusion or a milestone stage identified in the plan, in order that progress can be measured and celebrated, and a plan for further action agreed if required.",

    "title": "Why recognise and reward open research practice?",
    "section": "",
    "text": "This introductory section explains the rationale for recognising and rewarding open research in the assessment of researchers, with reference to the open research and responsible research assessment agendas that have evolved in recent years. It can be used as a reference text for a group of stakeholders undertaking a self-assessment exercise using the OR4 maturity framework, and to inform engagement in support of planned action, such as the development of business cases, consultation or co-development with stakeholders, and communications with the wider research community. It can serve to establish a shared understanding of open research and responsible research assessment, and an awareness of the drivers for strategic action in these areas in the higher education and research sector.\n\n\nThere are key reasons why open research practices are important in the context of researcher assessment:\n\nOpen practices support and demonstrate research integrity and quality, by providing transparency about research methods and evidence, and enabling independent verification or reproduction of findings\nOpen practices generate a variety of outputs in addition to research publications, such as datasets, software and digital resources, and facilitate their re-use, so maximising opportunities to generate further value\nThe broader range of activities and outputs associated with open research practices enables a more rounded assessment of a researcher’s activities and outputs than is possible where publications are the primary or exclusive focus of assessment.\n\nA researcher who uses open research practices better demonstrates and enables verification of the quality of their research, maximises the potential of their research to generate value, and is able to provide a more representative picture of the totality of their research and related activities.\nOperationalisation of open research incentives and expectations in the researcher assessment activities of research-performing organisations will signal that open practices are considered to be an essential part of how research is carried out. It will power the adoption of open research practices by researchers and lead to improvements in research integrity, quality and impact.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOpen research and its benefits\n\n\n\n\n\nUKRI describes open research in the following terms:\n\nOpen research, also widely referred to as open science, relates to how research is performed and how knowledge is shared based on the principle that research should be as open as possible. It also enables research to take advantage of digital technology.\nTransparency, openness, verification and reproducibility are important features of research and innovation. Open research helps to support and uphold these features across the whole lifecycle of research – improving public value, research integrity, reuse and innovation.\nOpen research also helps to support collaboration within and across disciplines. It is integral to a healthy research culture and environment.\n\nOpen research can be situated in the context of a global discourse about open knowledge and openness in academic practice (which often uses the term open science). In the open knowledge paradigm, ‘openness’ is integral to the practices by which research is conducted, communicated, evaluated, validated and instrumentalised. Open research practice is held to have a direct relationship to research integrity (through transparency of methods and outputs), research quality (through the use of evidentiary and reproducible practices), sustainability (through use of appropriate standards and formats, preservation infrastructure, and persistent identifiers), and reach and impact (through the accessibility and re-usability of outputs).\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe principles of open research have gained widespread acceptance in recent years, and the importance of openness in research is acknowledged by governments, funders, and research-performing institutions. The 2021 adoption by the UNESCO member states of its Recommendation on Open Science marks a significant milestone in this respect. Many public research funders and most research institutions in the UK have established policies on open access to research publications and the management and sharing of research data, which are fundamental open research practices. More recently, some institutions have adopted statements in support of open research, endorsing the principles and aims of open research and encouraging use of relevant open research practices.\nBut open research policies and statements are as yet relatively unintegrated into institutional research strategy and planning and actual research practice. Beyond high levels of compliance with open access mandates, driven in large part by the requirements of the UK’s Research Excellence Framework (REF), there is little evidence of widespread open research practice. Rates of effective data sharing remain low.1 Open research practices are for the most part not incentivised and rewarded; nor, with the exception of open access publication, are they systematically monitored or enforced, either by institutions or by the funders of research.\n\n\n\nAt present, very few institutional recruitment, promotion, probation and appraisal frameworks include reference to open research criteria or outputs other than research publications; standards and practices for evidencing a track record in open research are not well-established; and there is a lack of guidance, training and support related to open research for researchers and staff involved in assessment. In consequence, use of open research practices is rarely evidenced or considered in the formal assessment activities, and is in large part unmonitored by institutions.2\nWith momentum for research assessment reform building globally, there is an opportunity to integrate open research into revised researcher assessment frameworks and practices. Universities play a critical role in the systems of academic reward and recognition. It is in their power to include open research criteria in their recruitment specifications, probation objectives and promotion frameworks, performance and development review processes, and research planning activities. By this means researchers can be incentivised and supported to build a track record in open research and to present that track record in an assessment activity, while assessment practices can recognise and give credit for a record of open research practice. This will drive increased adoption of open research practices, and, in time, bear fruit in the recruitment and promotion of staff who are recognised for working in ways that increase the integrity, quality and impact of the institution’s research output.\n\n\n\nThe history of research assessment reform can be characterised in terms of an evolution from an agenda focused almost exclusively on the use of publication-based metrics towards a broader framework of responsible research assessment (Figure 1). This broader, more instrumental agenda considers research assessment as a means of enabling the best researchers to flourish, promoting diversity and inclusion, and supporting the production of high-quality research – in short, as a means to engineer research culture. Within this agenda, there has been growing attention to the role of open research practices in relation to research assessment.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 1: Milestones in the history of research assessment reform\n\n\n\nAlthough the San Francisco Declaration on Research Assessment (DORA, 2013), the founding text of research assessment reform, was primarily concerned with research publications and related metrics, its second recommendation adumbrates a broader assessment agenda:\n\nFor the purposes of research assessment, consider the value and impact of all research outputs (including datasets and software) in addition to research publications, and consider a broad range of impact measures including qualitative indicators of research impact, such as influence on policy and practice.\n\nWhile DORA mentions datasets and software as examples of other research outputs, it lacks the broader concept of open research that has developed in the years since its publication, and does not provide guidance on how other types of output might be included and assessed. The Leiden Manifesto and the Metric Tide report (both published in 2015) were similarly focused on the use of publication metrics.\nWith the more recent emergence of a broader framework of responsible research assessment,3 there has been increased attention to open research. A white paper from the League of European Universities (LERU) published in 2018 recommended that universities ‘endeavour to integrate Open Science dimensions in their HR and career frameworks as an explicit element in recruitment, performance evaluation and career advancement policies’.4 Also in 2018, the European Universities Association published the ‘EUA Roadmap on Research Assessment in the Transition to Open Science’, which argued:\n\nToday, research assessment and reward systems generally do not reflect important Open Science contributions, such as curating and sharing datasets and collections, documenting and sharing software (source code), or devoting time and energy to high-quality peer review. New approaches to research assessment that take into account Open Science contributions need to be identified and thoroughly discussed by academic communities.5\n\nThe ‘Hong Kong Principles for assessing researchers’ (2020) call for assessment to develop a much broader picture of a researcher’s contributions to research and society. It identifies as one of its five principles to ‘Reward the practice of open science (open research)’, and it makes a strong connection between research transparency and research integrity.6 The UNESCO Recommendation on Open Science (2021) also enjoins member states to remove barriers to open science relating to research and career evaluation and awards systems, stating: ‘Assessment of scientific contribution and career progression rewarding good open science practices is needed for operationalization of open science’.\nIn the Agreement on Reforming Research Assessment, published in 2022 by the Coalition for Advancing Research Assessment (CoARA), ‘openness’ is recognised as being integral to the practices by which research is conducted, communicated and validated, and is identified as a key dimension of research assessment. Under the ‘Quality and impact’ principle of research assessment it states: ‘Openness of research, and results that are verifiable and reproducible where applicable, strongly contribute to quality’. Under the principle ‘Diversity, inclusiveness and collaboration’, signatories agree to:\n\nConsider… the full range of research outputs, such as scientific publications, data, software, models, methods, theories, algorithms, protocols, workflows, exhibitions, strategies, policy contributions, etc., and reward research behaviour underpinning open science practices such as early knowledge and data sharing as well as open collaboration within science and collaboration with societal actors where appropriate.\n\n\n\n\nThe greater emphasis on open research in the research assessment reform agenda is relatively recent, and national and institutional research assessment policies have so far reflected a prevailing focus on publications and the responsible use of publication metrics. In a survey undertaken by the OR4 project in 2023, 44 or 73% of 60 UK institutions stated that they had a responsible research assessment statement or policy. The majority of these were focused on the responsible use of publication metrics.7 In scope and terminology many of these statements follow and reference DORA and the Leiden Manifesto.\nThe almost exclusive focus on the assessment of research publications is understandable, given their prominence in the systems of academic recognition and reward. In REF 2021, of 185,353 outputs submitted, 180,509 or 97.4% fell into the main academic publications categories A-E (including authored and edited books, book chapters, journal articles and conference contributions). 154,826 outputs or 83.5% of the total were journal articles. The number of research data sets and databases submitted was 31; the number of software outputs was 11 (Figure 2).8\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 2: REF 2021 submitted outputs by output type\n\n\n\nThis heavily skewed distribution is the focus of the Hidden REF initiative, which emerged in the runup to the 2021 REF. This campaign highlighted the lack of representation in submissions for non-academic research contributors (such as data scientists, technicians and research software engineers) and for ‘non-traditional’ outputs (i.e. other than publications). Now that the UK is on track for REF 2029, the Hidden REF is campaigning on a 5% manifesto: a target for HEIs to submit at least 5% of non-traditional research outputs. This will be a challenging target to meet, given that in REF 2021 only 2.4% of non-traditional outputs were submitted.\nBut the landscape is beginning to change, and institutions will need to develop policies that better align to the principles of responsible research assessment and that are more representative of the full diversity of research and research-related activities and outputs.\n\n\n\nIn comparison to previous national assessment exercises, REF 2029 places greater emphasis on institutional research culture, including use of open research practices. Institutions can provide evidence of this in the People, Culture and Environment element, while the element Contribution to Knowledge and Understanding enables a greater diversity of research activities and outputs to be evidenced.9\nAs the national research assessment framework progressively assimilates open research objectives and assessment criteria, institutions will be obliged to conform, and to integrate open research into their own policies, systems and processes. The greater emphasis on open research in the 2029 REF is consistent with international developments, where other national research environments are also beginning to demonstrate greater alignment to the principles embodied in the Agreement on Reforming Research Assessment, and to identify open research as an important element of incentive and reward systems.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOpen research in other national research assessment frameworks\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn the Netherlands, a 2020 report by the National Programme on Open Science argued that reform was needed on three levels: at the level of national assessment, at the institutional level, and at the level of funding agencies. The roadmap for the Dutch Recognition and Rewards Programme identifies open science as a priority, and aims to ‘clarify how activities relating to open science and open education will be considered and/or prioritised as a topic of discussion in the development, assessment, appointment and promotion of staff’.10 Funding has since been ringfenced by the Dutch Research Council (NWO) to support implementation and stimulation of open science culture and practices.\nIn 2021 Universities Norway published NOR-CAM, a national research assessment framework that integrates open science principles in the assessment of academic results, activities and competencies. NOR-CAM was developed from the Open Science Career Assessment Matrix (OS-CAM) proposed by the EU Working Group on Rewards under Open Science in 2017.11\nThe Irish National Action Plan for Open Research published in 2022 calls for an alignment of research assessment with the principles of open research at both national and institutional level as part of action to establish a culture of open research, and proposes among other actions adoption of a modified OS-CAM model to the national context.12\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEnsuring the meaningful inclusion of open research objectives in institutional researcher assessment and aligned research planning activities at all levels in an institution is a long-term challenge requiring a sustained effort of leadership and co-ordinated activity. Challenges can be summarised as political, cultural, practical and operational.\n\n\nThere is substantial institutional investment in the prevailing publication-based model of research assessment. Institutional research KPIs and research elements of league table rankings are largely defined by publication metrics. Not all research leaders, managers, and researchers will agree that use of open research practices is a relevant criterion of research assessment, and securing buy-in to support policy adoption and implementation across relevant procedures may not be straightforward.\n\n\n\nThere will be similar challenges securing engagement and bringing about changes in practice among members of the research community at large, in their capacity as both assessors and subjects of research assessment. Many will not have fully integrated open research practices into their working methods and may have concerns they would be disadvantaged. Care will need to be taken that where open research criteria are introduced in assessment practices their use is fair and equitable. Ability to evidence open research practice will depend on the discipline and type of research, and the background and career stage of a researcher. Researchers may have lacked the training, means or opportunity to use open research practices. All of these factors will necessitate the provision of guidance, training and support in the context of sustained activity to develop and enable a culture of open research practice.\n\n\n\nThe institution will need an effective operating definition of open research. Researchers and those involved in the assessment of researchers will need to be equipped to identify activities and outputs that fall under that definition, to make an assessment of the degree to which an activity or output fulfils qualifying criteria, and to appraise the value of the activity or output within the context of the assessment as a whole. Each of these requirements presents its own challenges. Many academics may struggle to identify open outputs, or fail to appreciate the difference between, say, a dataset that is published on a project website without a licence and one that has been deposited in a data repository under an open licence and assigned a DOI.\nIt is also the case that for many open research outputs there is no pre-publication peer review, and standards of assessment may be difficult to define and apply across a variety of outputs, even of the same type, meaning that outputs often lack markers of certification. It is also often difficult to obtain reliable, comparable quantitative information about the citation and use of many open research outputs, although a number of initiatives are addressing the collection and use of open research indicators and metrics.\n\n\n\nThere will be the complex work of implementing changes to policies and procedures, and underpinning systems, processes and support, creating and delivering guidance and training, monitoring compliance with implemented policies and taking follow-up action as required. This may entail development of or addition to existing systems and processes. Systems for management and assessment of research are based in large part on research publications, which are well-defined entities that support citation, quantification and comparison. Mature infrastructure, systems and processes facilitate their dissemination, and the collection and processing of information about them. Models for the integration of open research into institutional research assessment and research planning are yet to be established; but if research assessment is to accommodate a wider range of activities and outputs, this will introduce complexity and additional operational demand.\nThe OR4 implementation guide addresses these aspects of implementation, with an emphasis on the political and cultural aspects in the earlier sections moving into the practical and operational aspects in the later sections.",

Open research practice is held to have a direct relationship to research integrity (through transparency of methods and outputs), research quality (through the use of evidentiary and reproducible practices), sustainability (through use of appropriate standards and formats, preservation infrastructure, and persistent identifiers), and reach and impact (through the accessibility and re-usability of outputs).",

    "text": "The principles of open research have gained widespread acceptance in recent years, and the importance of openness in research is acknowledged by governments, funders, and research-performing institutions. The 2021 adoption by the UNESCO member states of its Recommendation on Open Science marks a significant milestone in this respect. Many public research funders and most research institutions in the UK have established policies on open access to research publications and the management and sharing of research data, which are fundamental open research practices. More recently, some institutions have adopted statements in support of open research, endorsing the principles and aims of open research and encouraging use of relevant open research practices.\nBut open research policies and statements are as yet relatively unintegrated into institutional research strategy and planning and actual research practice. Beyond high levels of compliance with open access mandates, driven in large part by the requirements of the UK’s Research Excellence Framework (REF), there is little evidence of widespread open research practice. Rates of effective data sharing remain low.1 Open research practices are for the most part not incentivised and rewarded; nor, with the exception of open access publication, are they systematically monitored or enforced, either by institutions or by the funders of research.",

    "text": "At present, very few institutional recruitment, promotion, probation and appraisal frameworks include reference to open research criteria or outputs other than research publications; standards and practices for evidencing a track record in open research are not well-established; and there is a lack of guidance, training and support related to open research for researchers and staff involved in assessment. In consequence, use of open research practices is rarely evidenced or considered in the formal assessment activities, and is in large part unmonitored by institutions.2\nWith momentum for research assessment reform building globally, there is an opportunity to integrate open research into revised researcher assessment frameworks and practices. Universities play a critical role in the systems of academic reward and recognition. It is in their power to include open research criteria in their recruitment specifications, probation objectives and promotion frameworks, performance and development review processes, and research planning activities. By this means researchers can be incentivised and supported to build a track record in open research and to present that track record in an assessment activity, while assessment practices can recognise and give credit for a record of open research practice. This will drive increased adoption of open research practices, and, in time, bear fruit in the recruitment and promotion of staff who are recognised for working in ways that increase the integrity, quality and impact of the institution’s research output.",

    "text": "The history of research assessment reform can be characterised in terms of an evolution from an agenda focused almost exclusively on the use of publication-based metrics towards a broader framework of responsible research assessment (Figure 1). This broader, more instrumental agenda considers research assessment as a means of enabling the best researchers to flourish, promoting diversity and inclusion, and supporting the production of high-quality research – in short, as a means to engineer research culture. Within this agenda, there has been growing attention to the role of open research practices in relation to research assessment.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 1: Milestones in the history of research assessment reform\n\n\n\nAlthough the San Francisco Declaration on Research Assessment (DORA, 2013), the founding text of research assessment reform, was primarily concerned with research publications and related metrics, its second recommendation adumbrates a broader assessment agenda:\n\nFor the purposes of research assessment, consider the value and impact of all research outputs (including datasets and software) in addition to research publications, and consider a broad range of impact measures including qualitative indicators of research impact, such as influence on policy and practice.\n\nWhile DORA mentions datasets and software as examples of other research outputs, it lacks the broader concept of open research that has developed in the years since its publication, and does not provide guidance on how other types of output might be included and assessed. The Leiden Manifesto and the Metric Tide report (both published in 2015) were similarly focused on the use of publication metrics.\nWith the more recent emergence of a broader framework of responsible research assessment,3 there has been increased attention to open research. A white paper from the League of European Universities (LERU) published in 2018 recommended that universities ‘endeavour to integrate Open Science dimensions in their HR and career frameworks as an explicit element in recruitment, performance evaluation and career advancement policies’.4 Also in 2018, the European Universities Association published the ‘EUA Roadmap on Research Assessment in the Transition to Open Science’, which argued:\n\nToday, research assessment and reward systems generally do not reflect important Open Science contributions, such as curating and sharing datasets and collections, documenting and sharing software (source code), or devoting time and energy to high-quality peer review. New approaches to research assessment that take into account Open Science contributions need to be identified and thoroughly discussed by academic communities.5\n\nThe ‘Hong Kong Principles for assessing researchers’ (2020) call for assessment to develop a much broader picture of a researcher’s contributions to research and society. It identifies as one of its five principles to ‘Reward the practice of open science (open research)’, and it makes a strong connection between research transparency and research integrity.6 The UNESCO Recommendation on Open Science (2021) also enjoins member states to remove barriers to open science relating to research and career evaluation and awards systems, stating: ‘Assessment of scientific contribution and career progression rewarding good open science practices is needed for operationalization of open science’.\nIn the Agreement on Reforming Research Assessment, published in 2022 by the Coalition for Advancing Research Assessment (CoARA), ‘openness’ is recognised as being integral to the practices by which research is conducted, communicated and validated, and is identified as a key dimension of research assessment. Under the ‘Quality and impact’ principle of research assessment it states: ‘Openness of research, and results that are verifiable and reproducible where applicable, strongly contribute to quality’. Under the principle ‘Diversity, inclusiveness and collaboration’, signatories agree to:\n\nConsider… the full range of research outputs, such as scientific publications, data, software, models, methods, theories, algorithms, protocols, workflows, exhibitions, strategies, policy contributions, etc., and reward research behaviour underpinning open science practices such as early knowledge and data sharing as well as open collaboration within science and collaboration with societal actors where appropriate.",

    "text": "The greater emphasis on open research in the research assessment reform agenda is relatively recent, and national and institutional research assessment policies have so far reflected a prevailing focus on publications and the responsible use of publication metrics. In a survey undertaken by the OR4 project in 2023, 44 or 73% of 60 UK institutions stated that they had a responsible research assessment statement or policy. The majority of these were focused on the responsible use of publication metrics.7 In scope and terminology many of these statements follow and reference DORA and the Leiden Manifesto.\nThe almost exclusive focus on the assessment of research publications is understandable, given their prominence in the systems of academic recognition and reward. In REF 2021, of 185,353 outputs submitted, 180,509 or 97.4% fell into the main academic publications categories A-E (including authored and edited books, book chapters, journal articles and conference contributions). 154,826 outputs or 83.5% of the total were journal articles. The number of research data sets and databases submitted was 31; the number of software outputs was 11 (Figure 2).8\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 2: REF 2021 submitted outputs by output type\n\n\n\nThis heavily skewed distribution is the focus of the Hidden REF initiative, which emerged in the runup to the 2021 REF. This campaign highlighted the lack of representation in submissions for non-academic research contributors (such as data scientists, technicians and research software engineers) and for ‘non-traditional’ outputs (i.e. other than publications). Now that the UK is on track for REF 2029, the Hidden REF is campaigning on a 5% manifesto: a target for HEIs to submit at least 5% of non-traditional research outputs. This will be a challenging target to meet, given that in REF 2021 only 2.4% of non-traditional outputs were submitted.\nBut the landscape is beginning to change, and institutions will need to develop policies that better align to the principles of responsible research assessment and that are more representative of the full diversity of research and research-related activities and outputs.",

    "text": "In comparison to previous national assessment exercises, REF 2029 places greater emphasis on institutional research culture, including use of open research practices. Institutions can provide evidence of this in the People, Culture and Environment element, while the element Contribution to Knowledge and Understanding enables a greater diversity of research activities and outputs to be evidenced.9\nAs the national research assessment framework progressively assimilates open research objectives and assessment criteria, institutions will be obliged to conform, and to integrate open research into their own policies, systems and processes. The greater emphasis on open research in the 2029 REF is consistent with international developments, where other national research environments are also beginning to demonstrate greater alignment to the principles embodied in the Agreement on Reforming Research Assessment, and to identify open research as an important element of incentive and reward systems.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOpen research in other national research assessment frameworks\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn the Netherlands, a 2020 report by the National Programme on Open Science argued that reform was needed on three levels: at the level of national assessment, at the institutional level, and at the level of funding agencies. The roadmap for the Dutch Recognition and Rewards Programme identifies open science as a priority, and aims to ‘clarify how activities relating to open science and open education will be considered and/or prioritised as a topic of discussion in the development, assessment, appointment and promotion of staff’.10 Funding has since been ringfenced by the Dutch Research Council (NWO) to support implementation and stimulation of open science culture and practices.\nIn 2021 Universities Norway published NOR-CAM, a national research assessment framework that integrates open science principles in the assessment of academic results, activities and competencies. NOR-CAM was developed from the Open Science Career Assessment Matrix (OS-CAM) proposed by the EU Working Group on Rewards under Open Science in 2017.11\nThe Irish National Action Plan for Open Research published in 2022 calls for an alignment of research assessment with the principles of open research at both national and institutional level as part of action to establish a culture of open research, and proposes among other actions adoption of a modified OS-CAM model to the national context.12",

    "text": "Ensuring the meaningful inclusion of open research objectives in institutional researcher assessment and aligned research planning activities at all levels in an institution is a long-term challenge requiring a sustained effort of leadership and co-ordinated activity. Challenges can be summarised as political, cultural, practical and operational.\n\n\nThere is substantial institutional investment in the prevailing publication-based model of research assessment. Institutional research KPIs and research elements of league table rankings are largely defined by publication metrics. Not all research leaders, managers, and researchers will agree that use of open research practices is a relevant criterion of research assessment, and securing buy-in to support policy adoption and implementation across relevant procedures may not be straightforward.\n\n\n\nThere will be similar challenges securing engagement and bringing about changes in practice among members of the research community at large, in their capacity as both assessors and subjects of research assessment. Many will not have fully integrated open research practices into their working methods and may have concerns they would be disadvantaged. Care will need to be taken that where open research criteria are introduced in assessment practices their use is fair and equitable. Ability to evidence open research practice will depend on the discipline and type of research, and the background and career stage of a researcher. Researchers may have lacked the training, means or opportunity to use open research practices. All of these factors will necessitate the provision of guidance, training and support in the context of sustained activity to develop and enable a culture of open research practice.\n\n\n\nThe institution will need an effective operating definition of open research. Researchers and those involved in the assessment of researchers will need to be equipped to identify activities and outputs that fall under that definition, to make an assessment of the degree to which an activity or output fulfils qualifying criteria, and to appraise the value of the activity or output within the context of the assessment as a whole. Each of these requirements presents its own challenges. Many academics may struggle to identify open outputs, or fail to appreciate the difference between, say, a dataset that is published on a project website without a licence and one that has been deposited in a data repository under an open licence and assigned a DOI.\nIt is also the case that for many open research outputs there is no pre-publication peer review, and standards of assessment may be difficult to define and apply across a variety of outputs, even of the same type, meaning that outputs often lack markers of certification. It is also often difficult to obtain reliable, comparable quantitative information about the citation and use of many open research outputs, although a number of initiatives are addressing the collection and use of open research indicators and metrics.\n\n\n\nThere will be the complex work of implementing changes to policies and procedures, and underpinning systems, processes and support, creating and delivering guidance and training, monitoring compliance with implemented policies and taking follow-up action as required. This may entail development of or addition to existing systems and processes. Systems for management and assessment of research are based in large part on research publications, which are well-defined entities that support citation, quantification and comparison. Mature infrastructure, systems and processes facilitate their dissemination, and the collection and processing of information about them. Models for the integration of open research into institutional research assessment and research planning are yet to be established; but if research assessment is to accommodate a wider range of activities and outputs, this will introduce complexity and additional operational demand.\nThe OR4 implementation guide addresses these aspects of implementation, with an emphasis on the political and cultural aspects in the earlier sections moving into the practical and operational aspects in the later sections.",

These can be considered when you develop an institutional action plan.\n\n\n\nAdopt and publish an open research statement.\nAdopt and publish a commitment to the implementation of responsible research assessment. In so far as it relates to open research, it could be linked to the open research statement.\nSign the Agreement on Reforming Research Assessment and join the Coalition on Advancing Research Assessment (CoARA) and communicate this within the institution.\n\n\n\n\n\nInitiate action to implement commitments, e.g. by appointment of senior strategic leads for open research and responsible research assessment, development and publication of action plans, and engagement of key stakeholders.\nInclude a commitment to recognise and reward open research practice within institutional research assessment.\nEnsure senior leads and stakeholder groups (where they have been established) are co-ordinated towards objectives for recognition and reward for open research.\nDemonstrate that progress has been made in implementing commitments, e.g. by publishing updates against action plan milestones.\n\n\n\n\n\nEnsure that commitments are well-integrated into relevant policies, procedures, assessment, guidance and training, and that they are widely understood and supported by research leaders and managers.\nEnsure that activities and communications relating to institutional research strategy, environment and culture are aligned to and reference institutional commitments.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIncreasing numbers of UK universities, and indeed institutions globally, are adopting public statements of commitment to the principles and aims of open research.1 Their function is to provide the strategic commitment to develop a culture of open research and the high-level framework under which activity and policies (such as those on open access and data sharing) can sit. The statement should be in alignment with (and may reference) the University’s research strategy. Reference to statements such as the UKRI position on open research and the UNESCO Recommendation on Open Science can serve to emphasise alignment to the sector.\nThe statement should include a commitment to recognise and reward open research practice, and reference an institutional statement or policy on responsible research assessment where this exists.\nMembers of the institution formulating this commitment will need to reflect on how open research is understood within the context of the institutional mission, and how it contributes to the advancement of that mission.\n\n\n\nWith momentum for research assessment reform building globally, many institutions are reviewing or planning to review their research assessment policies and procedures. This may entail publishing or refreshing a statement of commitment to the agenda of research assessment reform.\nMany institutions have already signed the San Francisco Declaration on Research Assessment (DORA) and will have made a commitment to improve research and researcher assessment within their institutions. As of 7th November 2022, DORA asked signatory institutions to ‘share a public statement detailing their commitment to DORA and responsible research assessment to their communities’.2\nWhether or not institutions are DORA signatories, there is a case for signing the Agreement on Reforming Assessment to begin the process of establishing specific commitments and a timetable of reform. Signatories commit to develop and share with CoARA within one year of signing the Agreement an action plan for reviewing or developing criteria, tools and processes in line with the core Commitments set out in the Agreement. They also agree to regularly demonstrate progress against this action plan, with a touch point within five years of signing the Agreement.\nInstitutions that receive funding from the Wellcome Trust are also required to publish on their website a commitment to the use of responsible research assessment aligned with the DORA and CoARA principles. They are expected to have a plan in place for implementing the principles, and for monitoring and reporting on implementation.\nA statement of institutional commitment to research assessment reform should include an undertaking to integrate open research criteria into systems of reward and recognition, in line with the emphasis placed on open research/open science in the Agreement and more recent discussions of responsible research assessment. It should also reference the statement of institutional commitment to open research, where this exists.\n\n\n\nAside from commitment explicitly based on or subscribing to the main research assessment reform initiatives, institutions might consider making supporting commitments, e.g.:\n\nThe More than Our Rank initiative provides an opportunity for academic institutions to highlight the problematic nature of league table rankings.\nThe Barcelona Declaration on Open Research Information asks institutions to commit to making openness the default for research information, and to challenge the status quo in which large amounts of research information are locked in proprietary profit-making infrastructures.\nThe Hidden REF 5% Manifesto encourages institutions to commit to submit at least 5% of their submissions to REF 2029 as non-traditional research outputs, to promote better representation for the range of research contribution roles and ‘non-traditional’ research outputs.\n\nWhether or not institutions sign up to all these commitments, discussion of them can be useful ways to highlight areas of practice in need of reform and to consider ways in which they might be addressed.\n\n\n\nPublishing commitments to open research or research assessment reform will be a collective effort, with stakeholder groups led by senior colleagues. Any commitment will be ineffective if the effort is not made to build the coalition that will implement it and if ownership and accountability are not built in. The process of developing an institutional statement will offer an opportunity to engage stakeholders through consultation, and to secure support for their achievement through strategic actions. Care should be taken to ensure that relevant stakeholder groups are represented in the process of developing and consulting on institutional commitments (including, for example, early career researchers and professional services colleagues) and that statements, once adopted, are communicated to the research community. Institutional commitments will need to be signed off at a high level, and there will need to be appropriate ownership of, and accountability for, delivering against the commitments.\nStrategic activities related to development of open research and research assessment reform may have separate origins within the institution and may be undertaken by separate groups under different leadership. Where this is the case, it will be important to ensure that their activities are co-ordinated on the common ground of reward and recognition for open research, and that there is agreement about objectives and the means of attainment. The process of developing and consulting on institutional statements should ensure this co-ordination and agreement take place.\nAgreement on the relevance and place of open research within research assessment cannot be taken for granted. One advantage of signing up to the Agreement on Reforming Research Assessment is that by doing so the institution subscribes to the Core Commitment to ‘Recognise the diversity of contributions to, and careers, in research in accordance with the needs and nature of the research’. The purpose of this Commitment is to broaden the range of research activities and outputs recognised, to include inter alia ‘diverse outputs beyond journal publications’ and ‘practices that contribute to robustness, openness, transparency and the inclusiveness of research’.\n\n\n\nThe institution will need to demonstrate over time that aspirational commitments are being realised and incorporated into business as usual. Published commitments can identify senior leads and groups responsible for implementing them, and include action plans and updates on progress against milestones. Where there are specific reporting expectations associated with external commitments, such as those associated with membership of CoARA, these can be communicated within the institution.\nActivities and communications relating to institutional research strategy, environment and culture should be aligned to and reference institutional commitments. Policies and procedures will in due course integrate elements of the open research commitments that have been realised and may reference them, as may relevant guidance and training. Internal communication channels can be used to communicate the open research commitments to key stakeholders and the broader research community. Management structures can be used to ensure the commitments are applied and referenced as appropriate.",

    "text": "Increasing numbers of UK universities, and indeed institutions globally, are adopting public statements of commitment to the principles and aims of open research.1 Their function is to provide the strategic commitment to develop a culture of open research and the high-level framework under which activity and policies (such as those on open access and data sharing) can sit. The statement should be in alignment with (and may reference) the University’s research strategy. Reference to statements such as the UKRI position on open research and the UNESCO Recommendation on Open Science can serve to emphasise alignment to the sector.\nThe statement should include a commitment to recognise and reward open research practice, and reference an institutional statement or policy on responsible research assessment where this exists.\nMembers of the institution formulating this commitment will need to reflect on how open research is understood within the context of the institutional mission, and how it contributes to the advancement of that mission.\n\n\n\nWith momentum for research assessment reform building globally, many institutions are reviewing or planning to review their research assessment policies and procedures. This may entail publishing or refreshing a statement of commitment to the agenda of research assessment reform.\nMany institutions have already signed the San Francisco Declaration on Research Assessment (DORA) and will have made a commitment to improve research and researcher assessment within their institutions. As of 7th November 2022, DORA asked signatory institutions to ‘share a public statement detailing their commitment to DORA and responsible research assessment to their communities’.2\nWhether or not institutions are DORA signatories, there is a case for signing the Agreement on Reforming Assessment to begin the process of establishing specific commitments and a timetable of reform. Signatories commit to develop and share with CoARA within one year of signing the Agreement an action plan for reviewing or developing criteria, tools and processes in line with the core Commitments set out in the Agreement. They also agree to regularly demonstrate progress against this action plan, with a touch point within five years of signing the Agreement.\nInstitutions that receive funding from the Wellcome Trust are also required to publish on their website a commitment to the use of responsible research assessment aligned with the DORA and CoARA principles. They are expected to have a plan in place for implementing the principles, and for monitoring and reporting on implementation.\nA statement of institutional commitment to research assessment reform should include an undertaking to integrate open research criteria into systems of reward and recognition, in line with the emphasis placed on open research/open science in the Agreement and more recent discussions of responsible research assessment. It should also reference the statement of institutional commitment to open research, where this exists.\n\n\n\nAside from commitment explicitly based on or subscribing to the main research assessment reform initiatives, institutions might consider making supporting commitments, e.g.:\n\nThe More than Our Rank initiative provides an opportunity for academic institutions to highlight the problematic nature of league table rankings.\nThe Barcelona Declaration on Open Research Information asks institutions to commit to making openness the default for research information, and to challenge the status quo in which large amounts of research information are locked in proprietary profit-making infrastructures.\nThe Hidden REF 5% Manifesto encourages institutions to commit to submit at least 5% of their submissions to REF 2029 as non-traditional research outputs, to promote better representation for the range of research contribution roles and ‘non-traditional’ research outputs.\n\nWhether or not institutions sign up to all these commitments, discussion of them can be useful ways to highlight areas of practice in need of reform and to consider ways in which they might be addressed.\n\n\n\nPublishing commitments to open research or research assessment reform will be a collective effort, with stakeholder groups led by senior colleagues. Any commitment will be ineffective if the effort is not made to build the coalition that will implement it and if ownership and accountability are not built in. The process of developing an institutional statement will offer an opportunity to engage stakeholders through consultation, and to secure support for their achievement through strategic actions. Care should be taken to ensure that relevant stakeholder groups are represented in the process of developing and consulting on institutional commitments (including, for example, early career researchers and professional services colleagues) and that statements, once adopted, are communicated to the research community. Institutional commitments will need to be signed off at a high level, and there will need to be appropriate ownership of, and accountability for, delivering against the commitments.\nStrategic activities related to development of open research and research assessment reform may have separate origins within the institution and may be undertaken by separate groups under different leadership. Where this is the case, it will be important to ensure that their activities are co-ordinated on the common ground of reward and recognition for open research, and that there is agreement about objectives and the means of attainment. The process of developing and consulting on institutional statements should ensure this co-ordination and agreement take place.\nAgreement on the relevance and place of open research within research assessment cannot be taken for granted. One advantage of signing up to the Agreement on Reforming Research Assessment is that by doing so the institution subscribes to the Core Commitment to ‘Recognise the diversity of contributions to, and careers, in research in accordance with the needs and nature of the research’. The purpose of this Commitment is to broaden the range of research activities and outputs recognised, to include inter alia ‘diverse outputs beyond journal publications’ and ‘practices that contribute to robustness, openness, transparency and the inclusiveness of research’.\n\n\n\nThe institution will need to demonstrate over time that aspirational commitments are being realised and incorporated into business as usual. Published commitments can identify senior leads and groups responsible for implementing them, and include action plans and updates on progress against milestones. Where there are specific reporting expectations associated with external commitments, such as those associated with membership of CoARA, these can be communicated within the institution.\nActivities and communications relating to institutional research strategy, environment and culture should be aligned to and reference institutional commitments. Policies and procedures will in due course integrate elements of the open research commitments that have been realised and may reference them, as may relevant guidance and training. Internal communication channels can be used to communicate the open research commitments to key stakeholders and the broader research community. Management structures can be used to ensure the commitments are applied and referenced as appropriate.",

Various routes should be available to provide feedback for substantive and iterative development of policy and procedure.\nReview policies and procedures on a regular basis to align with developments in open research practice.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRecognition and reward for open research will be relevant to and require incorporation in a range of institutional policies and procedures, including those concerning recruitment, academic probation, promotion and professorial review, performance and development review, and any other processes involving research appraisal and reward allocation. It will be important to ensure that institutional systems of reward and recognition are aligned and consistent between themselves.\nWe believe the most effective way to achieve this alignment and ensure consistency across relevant policies is to adopt an institutional research assessment policy to which other policies can be linked. Such a policy would set out the general principles of research assessment, which would include expectations and responsibilities related to open research. Relevant provisions could then be adopted into policies and procedures that involve the assessment of research or researchers.\nThis is not necessarily the only option for implementing relevant policy provisions. They might also be progressively integrated into existing policies, for example, beginning with the academic promotion policy, then moving on to recruitment and probation, performance and development review, etc. This may be a more practicable option in some institutions.\n\n\n\nThe emphasis on open research as a dimension of research that should be considered in research assessment is relatively recent. (This is discussed in the Introduction.) Where institutions have adopted policies relating to research assessment, so far these have mostly been focused on publications and the responsible use of publication metrics.1 There is consequently both a need to update existing research assessment policies and a lack of established models for policies that reflect a broader concept of responsible research assessment, especially any that include explicit recognition of open research.\nThere is also the challenge of articulating open research expectations and requirements fairly, and in a meaningful and realistic way, within any research assessment policy, given that current awareness and practice on the part of researchers are at a relatively low level. Any policy must take account of various factors, in particular:\n\nresearchers will come from different institutional and cultural backgrounds, which will have influenced the degree to which they are aware of and have had opportunity to use open research practices;\nthe relevance of open research practices and benchmarks will vary by discipline and type of research. Some disciplines may have more advanced cultures of data sharing or using pre-registration than others; relevant of open research practices and policy expectations will depend on the type of research: data sharing expectations cannot apply where research has not involved collecting data. Policy expectations must be formulated so that they can be applied in ways that are meaningful for specific disciplines and, within disciplines, for specific types of research;\nthe existence and scale of any track record in open research will depend on the career stage of the applicant and their employment history, which may include career breaks, or employment in industry or other areas that have not provided opportunities to use open research practices.\n\nInstitutions will approach the development of policy, and the inclusion of open research within it, in different ways, but it will be important to ensure the process of policy development is inclusive and the end result embodies the values of the institution. The SCOPE Framework for Research Evaluation developed by the Institutional Network of Research Management Societies (INORMS) is an excellent practical model that can be used to support the an inclusive process of policy co-development and implementation. It includes a number of case studies that demonstrate how different institutions have used the Framework to develop research assessment policies.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n‘There was a need to make allowances for adjustments in Schools to support individual and discipline-specific requirements and approaches. This was particularly true for open research practices, which are currently adopted to different degrees across disciplines. Similarly, career stage was a consideration, as earlier-career researchers tend to be more familiar with open research practices than senior researchers.’ University of Bristol\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPolicies and procedures that would need to take account of open research criteria include those relating to recruitment, probation, promotion, and professorial review, performance and development review, and other forms of reward and recognition, e.g. awards of institutional funding and other prizes.\nThe process of updating policies and procedures is likely to require a substantive collaborative development and consultation phase and could be driven by a research assessment reform group, an existing group with authority in these areas, or an empowered institutional lead. There may be discussion with policy owners over the precise nature of the changes, how and by whom any support requirements will be met, and the provision of additional resources to support implementation. It will be important to reach agreement on these matters if the policy is to be implemented effectively. It will also be necessary to ensure there is appropriate reference to open research expectations/requirements in any update of related policy and procedure documents, and guidance and support are signposted. For example, an academic promotion framework may need to update its criteria to include specification of open research, with information for both promotion panels and candidates providing links to any relevant policy information, guidance and training.\n\n\n\nAcademic promotion and professorial review policies customarily define assessment frameworks in which a number of assessment criteria are identified, usually under broad categories such as Academic citizenship and leadership, Research, and Teaching and learning.\nThere have been some efforts to create models of academic assessment frameworks in which open science is a defining dimension of academic activity and assessment. These have been European initiatives, where ‘open science’ may encompass not just open research activities and outputs, but other knowledge-related activities such as innovation, the creation of impact, public engagement, and teaching and supervision. These models of academic assessment frameworks may be of use to institutions that are planning or undertaking a review of academic development and assessment pathways and frameworks.\nIn such frameworks, recognition can be given not just for practising open research directly, but for contributing to a culture in which open research is enabled and practised, for example by delivering training in open research practices,2 by using open research products in teaching, or by developing or curating infrastructure that supports open research, e.g. community data standards. These frameworks are consistent with the ambition of the Coalition for Advancing Research Assessment to expand the range of activities and outputs recognised in research assessment.\nIn 2017 the EU report ‘Evaluation of research careers fully acknowledging Open Science practices’3 proposed an Open Science Career Assessment Matrix (OS-CAM) in which open science is a guiding principle, and the full spectrum of open science practices, including open access to publications, open data, open peer review, research integrity, citizen science and stakeholder engagement, is taken into account. In the proposed framework all aspects of a researcher’s career, output and activities are included in the assessment, and all outputs and activities are assessed on the basis of their degree of openness.\nThe OPUS project, which began in 2022, has built on the foundation laid by OS-CAM to produce a comprehensive researcher assessment framework which includes an open science dimension designed to support recognition and reward for open science practices. The framework structures indicators in four categories of activities, for Research, Education, Leadership and Valorisation, thus providing an ‘open’ lens with which to view the full range of an academic’s activities. The framework is being tested and refined in collaboration with pilot institutions. It uses a modular design so that the framework can be customised to meet the requirements of the individual institution.\n\n\n\nIncluding open research in the University of Bristol’s Academic Promotions Framework",

Relevant outputs may include research data, code, software, digital resources, preregistered study designs, methods and protocols, preprints, peer reviews and hardware designs. Open research may also include citizen science that involves members of the public in the design and execution of research. The principles of open research are affirmed in the UNESCO Recommendation on Open Science adopted by member states (see entry below), and are widely recognised by funders1 and research-performing organisations2. Our definition of open research is intended to recognise common understanding without attempting to be definitive; we recognise that institutions will define open research in different ways and will highlight different aspects of the concept to reflect local circumstances and requirements.",

    "section": "",
    "text": "Executive summary\n\nThe importance and benefits of open research are widely accepted. Many institutions explicitly subscribe to open research principles in support of greater transparency and reproducibility. Institutional policies for open access to publications and research data management and sharing are standard and reflect expectations across the sector. Policy drivers and compliance requirements related to open research are set to increase. But institutional commitments and open research policies are relatively unintegrated into research strategy, planning and management, and currently have limited influence on the behaviour of individual researchers. Systems of recognition and reward that operate in the recruitment, probation, promotion and appraisal of researchers can be powerful engines of behavioural change, but at present they do not effectively incentivise or reward open research practice.\nOpen research practices should be a part of how researchers are assessed, because a researcher who uses such practices:\n\nbetter demonstrates, and enables verification of, the quality of their research;\nfacilitates re-use of the products of their research, in this way maximising their potential value and impact;\nis able to provide a more representative picture of their research activities and outputs, enabling a more informed assessment of their capacity as a researcher.\n\nOperationalisation of open research incentives and expectations in the researcher assessment activities of research-performing organisations will signal that open practices are considered to be an essential part of how research is carried out. It will power the adoption of open research practices by researchers and lead to improvements in research integrity, quality and impact.\nWith momentum for research assessment reform building globally, there is an opportunity to integrate open research into revised researcher assessment frameworks and practices. Since the publication of the San Francisco Declaration on Research Assessment (DORA) in 2013, there has been an evolution in the research assessment reform agenda from an initial focus on responsible use of publication metrics towards a wider responsible research assessment framework. This has entailed increasing attention to elements related to research culture, research integrity and reproducibility, as represented most fully in the Agreement on Reforming Research Assessment published in 2022 by the Coalition for Advancing Research Assessment (CoARA).\nThis broader agenda is shaping the national research assessment framework in the UK as in other countries. The People, Culture and Environment element of the next Research Excellence Framework (REF) will include a greater emphasis on elements of research culture including open research. This is indicative of the direction of travel in the sector towards a more instrumental model of research assessment, which shapes the norms and expectations associated with good research practice. Open research is an integral feature of good research practice as defined by this model.\nInstitutions therefore need to start developing researcher assessment policies to integrate recognition and reward for open research. This work will involve a number of challenges of implementation, which can be characterised at four levels:\n\npolitical: getting buy-in from institutional leaders and managers and key stakeholders in professional services to support policy adoption and implementation across relevant procedures;\ncultural: securing assent from members of the research community in their capacity as both assessors and subjects of research assessment to the inclusion of open research in research assessment, and bringing about changes in practice;\npractical: defining open research in such a way that instances of it can be demonstrated, identified, validated, and qualitatively evaluated within the context of an overall assessment, and providing the training and guidance that enables researchers and assessors to use the criteria effectively;\noperational: implementing the changes to policies and procedures and underpinning systems, processes and support, creating and delivering guidance and training, and monitoring and managing compliance with implemented policies.\n\nThe implementation guide addresses these aspects of implementation, with an emphasis on the political and cultural aspects in the earlier sections moving into the practical and operational aspects in the later sections.",

    "text": "Does your institution provide leadership at a senior level for strategic action on open research and responsible research assessment, including recognition and reward for open research, and is open research leadership fostered at all levels in the institution?\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRecognition and reward for open research may be implemented at the intersection of strategic activities to develop open research culture and to undertake research assessment reform. Where these activities are separately led, leaders in both areas must accept and agree on the objectives to be achieved, in order for implementation to be effective.\nRecognition and reward for open research in research assessment is relatively undeveloped. There is a risk that its importance will not be appreciated or factored into activity. It will be essential to have an informed and empowered advocate who is able to ensure open research is within scope of activity and given due weight.\nLeadership can be demonstrated by those in positions of influence, as research leaders and managers and senior members of professional services; as professional services colleagues who might support good practice though the provision of services, guidance and training; and as informal or nominated advocates of open research.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNo Action\nEmerging\nEvolving\nSustained\n\n\n\n\nThere is no senior strategic leadership for open research or responsible research assessment.\nThere are identified senior strategic leads for open research and responsible research assessment. Recognition and reward for open research in research assessment is an identified priority for strategic action.\nSenior leadership develops actions on open research and responsible research assessment in collaboration with key stakeholders. Actions to recognise open research in research assessment are agreed and supported by relevant leads and promoted by open research advocates across the institution.\nRecognition and reward for open research in research assessment is progressed as a strategic priority by members of senior management. External engagement ensures alignment to sector. Leadership in open research is seen and valued across the organisation, and includes researchers, research enablers and open research advocates.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHere are suggestions for key actions that can be taken to progress from one level of the maturity framework to the next. These can be considered when you develop an institutional action plan.\n\n\n\nNominate and empower a member of senior management or professional services with responsibility for strategic action to develop open research culture and practice.\nNominate and empower a senior strategic lead for responsible research assessment.\nIdentify recognition and reward for open research as a priority for strategic action.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEvidence activity by senior strategic leads for open research and responsible research assessment and engagement with relevant stakeholders. Where leadership of open research and responsible research assessment is separate, ensure there is co-ordinated action and agreement on objectives to include recognition and reward for open research.\nIdentify and develop advocates in the research community and professional services who can provide leadership and support for open research recognition and reward.\n\n\n\n\n\nDemonstrate progress in embedding culture change under the direction of the senior strategic lead.\nCascade open research leadership through the organisation, with research leaders and managers, research professionals and other champions showing leadership in their areas of activity and influence.\nDemonstrate that championing open research practice is a recognised criterion of research leadership, for example through inclusion in job descriptions, promotion criteria, and performance and development review.\nDemonstrate that leadership in the institution is engaging externally with research assessment reform networks in order to promote effective recognition and reward for open research across the sector.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nA member of senior management with responsibility for developing open research culture and practice within the institution can develop and lead strategic action and act as a senior champion for open research. This person will represent the institutional commitment to open research and act as a strong advocate for the open research interest. They must be sufficiently informed about open research and convinced of its importance to be a strong advocate. This will be essential where research assessment reform activity is separately led, and discussion may be required to ensure that recognition and reward for open research is within scope of activity and given appropriate weight.\nAn open research lead is likely to have greatest impact when this is a role with authority to instigate institution-wide change e.g., a PVC for Research, Dean, senior professional services manager, or someone at a similar level. The role may be most effective where there are defined responsibilities and accountability, for example to develop, implement and report on the progress of a plan of strategic action to increase open research culture and practice in the institution. For members of the UKRN, the role could fit well with that of Institutional Lead: members of the UKRN are required to appoint a senior academic to this role, with responsibility for research improvement and research integrity, reporting to the PVC for Research (or their equivalent). The Institutional Lead role is expected to make a minimum commitment of 1 day per week (0.2FTE). Stakeholders within institutions that lack an open research lead and are not currently members of UKRN may be able to use the case for membership as a vehicle for securing senior management leadership for open research.\nAction to develop open research culture and practice in the institution would ideally be undertaken by a group convened for the purpose under the senior lead for open research and comprising representatives of key stakeholder groups, including the academic community and relevant professional services. But the existence and scope of such a group, and its actions, will vary across institutions according to research priorities and available resources.\n\n\n\nImplementation of recognition and reward for open research will require leadership in promoting the need for change within the institution, engaging key stakeholders and the wider community to secure buy-in and manage resistance, and in managing a stakeholder group tasked with delivering established objectives.\nImplementation may sit at the intersection of otherwise separate activities to address research assessment reform and to develop open research culture and practice. These activities may be undertaken by separate groups under the direction of different senior leads within the institution. Where this is the situation, the lead for open research will need to make the case for recognition of open research within institutional assessment and ensure that there is agreement with the lead for research assessment reform on the objectives to be achieved and the means by which they will be achieved. This agreement may have been established through the process of developing institutional commitments to open research and research assessment reform.\n\n\n\nWhile the focus of senior leadership roles will be on activity within the institution, there will also be opportunities for external engagement. Leadership here may help to promote alignment in policies for recognition of open research within research assessment, at the level of national assessment (i.e. through the REF), by funders when assessing researchers and institutions for the award of grants, and between institutions, so that researchers are assessed by similar standards at all institutions. Representation in national fora such as the CoARA National Chapter (for CoARA members) and the OR4 community of practice afford opportunities to exchange knowledge and practice and to co-ordinate activities across the UK sector.\n\n\n\nResearch leaders and managers have a role to play in developing a research environment that incentivises researchers to use open research practices, as well as in the specific promotion of recognition and reward for open research. According to their roles and institutional requirements they may do any of the following:\n\npromote the use of open research practices in the areas under their authority, including compliance with relevant policy expectations, such as those relating to open access publication and data sharing;\nset an example by demonstrating good open research practice in their own work and professional relationships;\nuse communication activities to highlight and celebrate the open research activities and outputs of colleagues;\nengage with and signpost to colleagues the professional services that provide support for open research, such as research publishing and research data management services;\nsupport researchers at all levels to develop their knowledge and skills through the training and support provided by the institution;\nuse research planning and internal review processes to identify and, if required, report on attainment of open research objectives at group or individual level, as relevant;\nmonitor activity and compliance, and take appropriate action in cases of non-compliance or poor practice, such as arranging for additional support or training;\nensure that activities involving the assessment of researchers under their authority (e.g. recruitment and probation, promotion, performance and development review, etc.) implement appropriate recognition and reward for open research.\n\n\n\n\nLeadership will also be required at different levels and in different places in the institution to champion the open research agenda, and specific activity to include recognition and reward for open research in research assessment. Champions may be:\n\nmembers of professional services who will support implementation: both those who provide open research support and training and have a strong investment in promoting open research practice, and others such as HR professionals who may have specific roles to play in implementing and promoting new policies and procedures;\nadvocates for good practice in research, who may be formally nominated in some capacity, or have some informal role. Examples include open research champions, UK Reproducibility Network Local Network Leads, etc.",

    "text": "A member of senior management with responsibility for developing open research culture and practice within the institution can develop and lead strategic action and act as a senior champion for open research. This person will represent the institutional commitment to open research and act as a strong advocate for the open research interest. They must be sufficiently informed about open research and convinced of its importance to be a strong advocate. This will be essential where research assessment reform activity is separately led, and discussion may be required to ensure that recognition and reward for open research is within scope of activity and given appropriate weight.\nAn open research lead is likely to have greatest impact when this is a role with authority to instigate institution-wide change e.g., a PVC for Research, Dean, senior professional services manager, or someone at a similar level. The role may be most effective where there are defined responsibilities and accountability, for example to develop, implement and report on the progress of a plan of strategic action to increase open research culture and practice in the institution. For members of the UKRN, the role could fit well with that of Institutional Lead: members of the UKRN are required to appoint a senior academic to this role, with responsibility for research improvement and research integrity, reporting to the PVC for Research (or their equivalent). The Institutional Lead role is expected to make a minimum commitment of 1 day per week (0.2FTE). Stakeholders within institutions that lack an open research lead and are not currently members of UKRN may be able to use the case for membership as a vehicle for securing senior management leadership for open research.\nAction to develop open research culture and practice in the institution would ideally be undertaken by a group convened for the purpose under the senior lead for open research and comprising representatives of key stakeholder groups, including the academic community and relevant professional services. But the existence and scope of such a group, and its actions, will vary across institutions according to research priorities and available resources.\n\n\n\nImplementation of recognition and reward for open research will require leadership in promoting the need for change within the institution, engaging key stakeholders and the wider community to secure buy-in and manage resistance, and in managing a stakeholder group tasked with delivering established objectives.\nImplementation may sit at the intersection of otherwise separate activities to address research assessment reform and to develop open research culture and practice. These activities may be undertaken by separate groups under the direction of different senior leads within the institution. Where this is the situation, the lead for open research will need to make the case for recognition of open research within institutional assessment and ensure that there is agreement with the lead for research assessment reform on the objectives to be achieved and the means by which they will be achieved. This agreement may have been established through the process of developing institutional commitments to open research and research assessment reform.\n\n\n\nWhile the focus of senior leadership roles will be on activity within the institution, there will also be opportunities for external engagement. Leadership here may help to promote alignment in policies for recognition of open research within research assessment, at the level of national assessment (i.e. through the REF), by funders when assessing researchers and institutions for the award of grants, and between institutions, so that researchers are assessed by similar standards at all institutions.

Many institutions have already developed communication and engagement activities to support strategic activity related to open research. Examples of such activities include:\n\nthe publication of an open research statement;\nthe provision of information, guidance and case studies of open research practice;\nthe organisation of conference and workshop events themed around open research topics;\nopen research award competitions;\nthe appointment of open research champions;\ncommunications related to significant open research developments, such as the adoption of a rights retention policy for publications by the institution.\n\nThese activities may not always sit within a single strategic communications plan; they may be undertaken by different stakeholders within the organisation and may not be explicitly organised around an open research theme. However, to progress through to maturity, institutions would be expected to have a structured plan for communication related to reward and recognition for open research.\nBy developing an open research communication and engagement plan, the open research stakeholder group can facilitate a strategic and co-ordinated approach to communications, in order to target these effectively and communicate key messages. A stakeholder analysis can help with this. It will largely overlap with the stakeholder analysis for research assessment reform, although there may be those with specific interests and expertise in open research who will need to be engaged, including:\n\nmembers of any stakeholder group overseeing strategic action related to open research;\nmembers of professional services who support open research, such as colleagues supporting open access and research data management and research software engineers, as well as those who may support procedures that will be affected, such as colleagues in HR;\nopen research advocates, such as UKRN Local Network Leads or those in other institutionally appointed champion roles, and individuals who have a profile as open research advocates.\n\n\n\n\nCommunications related to implementation of recognition and reward for open research are likely to be developed and managed as part of the communications plan for research assessment reform.\nKey phases of communication might be:\n\nsignalling intent and engaging key stakeholders: this phase might accompany the making of any institutional commitments, such as signing the Agreement on Reforming Research Assessment;\nconsultation or co-development with key stakeholders, for example, in relation to a draft research assessment policy, or proposed changes to academic promotion criteria;\npublication and promotion of policy, guidance and training;\nongoing communications to consolidate and embed changes, increase awareness, and ensure those affected are informed about expectations, requirements and support, using research leaders and managers, relevant research support functions, such as HR and open research support teams, and open research champions to target and amplify key messages;\nensuring there is representation of researchers’ interests on strategic oversight groups, so that there is a formal channel for feedback about policy and procedures, and providing inclusive mechanisms for review and amendment of policy.\n\nCommunications and engagement planning will need to take account of likely resistances and concerns. Not everyone will agree that open research should be recognised and rewarded in research assessment activities. There may be disagreement about how criteria should be articulated in policy, and how they should be applied, given that relevance of open research practices will be a function of both a resarcher’s discipline and the type of research they have engaged in. There are likely to be concerns about the risks of disadvantaging those who by reason of discipline, type of research, career stage, protected characteristics and professional and cultural background may not have had the same opportunties as others to learn and apply open practices in their research.\nThis highlights the importance of developing policy through an inclusive process that embraces representatives of relevant stakeholder groups, engaging researchers at all levels and across a relevant range of diversity, as well as formal representatives, such as unions and institutional EDI leads, and ensuring that policy objectives and proposals are communicated within a genuinely collaborative dialogue. A co-develpment model, such as the SCOPE Framework for Research Evaluation can provide a robust framework for such an inclusive policy development process.",

This will require establishment of the baseline from which change starts, and monitoring over time to measure progress towards identified goals. Repeated assessments using the Recognising and rewarding open research maturity framework may enable an institution to gain an overview of progress over time. Institutions are also likely to have their own priority areas and initiatives to evaluate which may consider more specific outcomes. Implementation progress can be reported to the institutional sponsor group. This may also be the group to which ongoing progress post-implementation will be reported.\nGiven the number and variety of researcher assessment activities that an institution undertakes, a representative sampling approach may be necessary. For example, relevant activities in a small number of Schools or Departments might be observed during a defined time period. The same activities in the same areas could then be observed during similar time periods at later dates. These may be the areas in which changes to procedures are piloted before being rolled out more widely. The selection should ensure that a suitable variety of disciplinary cultures is represented, for example by including sciences, social sciences and arts and humanities disciplines. On a longer-term basis a random sampling approach across all areas of institutional activity might be used.\nIt will be necessary to define the information of relevance and the methods of data collection by which current practice can be characterised and progress measured. There is a wide range of open research indicators which could be considered. In respect of recognition and reward for open research, examples of methods by which data might be obtained include:\n\nanalysis of a sample of job advertisements for open research criteria/keywords;\nanalysis of a sample of applications for e.g. the presence of open research keywords, citation of outputs other than peer-reviewed publications;\ndocumentation of review processes, for example by the chair of a panel. This might be a checklist-based exercise to capture evidence about use of metrics and open research criteria in assessment;\ncollection of feedback from candidates and committees/panels, which could ask about the role of open research considerations in assessment;\ncollection of data on completion of training in responsible research assessment which addresses recognition and reward for open research.\n\nThis information can provide indicative data about compliance with policy across the institution and support evaluation of the impact and effectiveness of policy.\n\n\n\nGiven that the changes being introduced are not just procedural but cultural, it can be expected that they will take a considerable time to become embedded in business as usual. For a researcher to be able to evidence open research practices, they must have used those practices, and given the current low levels of adoption, many researchers may have little evidence to offer. But the progressive evolution of open research culture and practice will in due course increase the volume of evidence available, and the knowledge that open research is recognised and rewarded by an institution will be one important factor among others driving that increase in volume.\nIt will be important to be able to identify non-compliance and sub-optimal practice, so that remedial action can be put in place, for example by means of changes to procedures, targeted communications, conversations as part of performance and development review, and support or training.",

    "text": "Monitoring and reporting on activities can formalise expectations and support effective implementation of research assessment reform, including recognition and reward for open research. This will require establishment of the baseline from which change starts, and monitoring over time to measure progress towards identified goals. Repeated assessments using the Recognising and rewarding open research maturity framework may enable an institution to gain an overview of progress over time. Institutions are also likely to have their own priority areas and initiatives to evaluate which may consider more specific outcomes. Implementation progress can be reported to the institutional sponsor group. This may also be the group to which ongoing progress post-implementation will be reported.\nGiven the number and variety of researcher assessment activities that an institution undertakes, a representative sampling approach may be necessary. For example, relevant activities in a small number of Schools or Departments might be observed during a defined time period. The same activities in the same areas could then be observed during similar time periods at later dates. These may be the areas in which changes to procedures are piloted before being rolled out more widely. The selection should ensure that a suitable variety of disciplinary cultures is represented, for example by including sciences, social sciences and arts and humanities disciplines. On a longer-term basis a random sampling approach across all areas of institutional activity might be used.\nIt will be necessary to define the information of relevance and the methods of data collection by which current practice can be characterised and progress measured. There is a wide range of open research indicators which could be considered. In respect of recognition and reward for open research, examples of methods by which data might be obtained include:\n\nanalysis of a sample of job advertisements for open research criteria/keywords;\nanalysis of a sample of applications for e.g. the presence of open research keywords, citation of outputs other than peer-reviewed publications;\ndocumentation of review processes, for example by the chair of a panel. This might be a checklist-based exercise to capture evidence about use of metrics and open research criteria in assessment;\ncollection of feedback from candidates and committees/panels, which could ask about the role of open research considerations in assessment;\ncollection of data on completion of training in responsible research assessment which addresses recognition and reward for open research.\n\nThis information can provide indicative data about compliance with policy across the institution and support evaluation of the impact and effectiveness of policy.\n\n\n\nGiven that the changes being introduced are not just procedural but cultural, it can be expected that they will take a considerable time to become embedded in business as usual. For a researcher to be able to evidence open research practices, they must have used those practices, and given the current low levels of adoption, many researchers may have little evidence to offer. But the progressive evolution of open research culture and practice will in due course increase the volume of evidence available, and the knowledge that open research is recognised and rewarded by an institution will be one important factor among others driving that increase in volume.\nIt will be important to be able to identify non-compliance and sub-optimal practice, so that remedial action can be put in place, for example by means of changes to procedures, targeted communications, conversations as part of performance and development review, and support or training.",

    "text": "Overview\nThe implementation guide provides detailed guidance for institutions on implementing effective recognition and reward for open research in researcher assessment. It can be used by a group of stakeholders to develop a shared understanding of the rationale for recognising and rewarding open research practice and to explore different aspects of implementation in greater depth, in order to support informed planning and implementation. It can be consulted in conjunction with the maturity framework and as part of an institutional self-assessment exercise.\nAn executive summary provides a high-level overview of the context and rationale for strategic action and the main areas of implementation covered by the guide. This is a a useful one-pager for those who want a summary of the essentials.\nThe introductory section, Why recognise and reward open research practice? explains the rationale for strategic action with reference to the wider sector context in more detail. This is a more developed treatment of the subject and can be used by members of a stakeholder group to establish a shared understanding and sense of purpose.\nThe nine sections mapped to the action areas of the maturity framework are designed to enable members of the stakeholder group to develop a more in-depth understanding of the key areas in which action may be required, and to create a practical plan of action to develop institutional maturity. Links to case studies illustrating different aspects of implementation are provided.\nA Glossary of key terms is also included.\nEach of the nine main sections of the guide follows a standard format:\n\nWhy is this important?\nMaturity scale: the maturity scale for this action area\nProgress actions: suggested key actions to move from one level of the maturity scale to the next\nMain areas of activity: in-depth guidance\nCase studies: links to case studies illustrating different aspects of implementation at UK institutions"

It will need to explain the principles of research assessment, and the criteria and methods by which assessment is to be undertaken.\nTransparency about assessment criteria and methods is essential. Candidates for assessment, whether applicants for jobs from outside the institution, colleagues undergoing probation or annual performance review, or those applying for promotion, will need to be sufficiently informed about assessment criteria and methods to be able to present their track records appropriately and effectively. Guidance will need to be publicly accessible online, so that it can be referred to by job applicants.\nThis guidance will need to include appropriate discussion of the recognition of open research in assessment, and to link to any open research statement, supporting information, and sources of support.

This might cover, for example:\n\ndefining open research, in terms of types of practices and outputs that could be cited as evidence, and characteristics of good practice, e.g. sharing of outputs using open and standard licences, use of sustainable infrastructure such as repositories and persistent identifiers, conformity to FAIR Principles;\npublishing and/or linking to case studies of open research practice across different fields, so that researchers can identify practices relevant to their discipline and type of research. The UK Reproducibility Network provides an extensive compendium of open research across disciplines. A number of institutions have also published open research case studies, in some cases genereated through open research award initiatives.1\nspecifying the criteria by which evidence of open research will be assessed, and its role within the overall assessment, in alignment with the institution’s research assessment policy;\nproviding guidance on how to cite a variety of open research outputs across a range of disciplines and types of research, with examples of good citation practice;\nillustrating how a narrative presentation of track record might demonstrate the value of open research activities and outputs, through evidence of use, reach and impact, provided in accordance with responsible research assessment principles;\nsignposting further information and support.\n\n\n\n\nTraining in responsible research assessment including consideration of recognition and reward for open research should be provided for staff undertaking assessment and for those preparing to go through a formal assessment process.

Training may be delivered as an e-learning course to provide a basic level of understanding at scale, and as online or face-to-face sessions to develop more in-depth knowledge and skill. Records of completion of training maintained in institutional training systems can be used to monitor compliance.
