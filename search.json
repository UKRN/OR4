    "text": "The Recognising and rewarding open research maturity framework and self-assessment tool can be used by a group of stakeholders in an institution to assess maturity in the implementation of recognition and reward for open research, to support internal discussion and planning, and to measure ongoing progress.\nThe maturity framework describes four levels of maturity across nine action areas:\n\nNo Action: There is currently no action in this area\nEmerging: There is some developing activity in this area, but it is relatively unsystematic and lacking in strong strategic direction\nEvolving: Activity is developing in a systematic and strategic fashion in this area and is demonstrating progress against defined objectives\nSustained: Activity has implemented its main strategic objectives and is consolidating and embedding on a business-as-usual basis.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAction Area\nNo Action\nEmerging\nEvolving\nSustained\n\n\n\n\nInstitutional commitment\nThere are no public institutional commitments to open research and responsible research assessment.\nThere are public institutional commitments to open research and responsible research assessment but little or no recognition of open research in research assessment practice.\nThere are public institutional commitments to open research and responsible research assessment. There is an explicit commitment to recognise and reward open research in research assessment practice.\nPublic open research and responsible research assessment commitments are well-integrated into recognition and reward policies and procedures. There is a strong shared understanding of how open research and responsible research assessment contribute to institutional research strategy and overall mission.\n\n\nLeadership\nThere is no senior strategic leadership for open research or responsible research assessment.\nThere are identified senior strategic leads for open research and responsible research assessment. Recognition and reward for open research in research assessment is an identified priority for strategic action.\nSenior leadership develops actions on open research and responsible research assessment in collaboration with key stakeholders. Actions to recognise open research in research assessment are agreed and supported by relevant leads and promoted by open research advocates across the institution.\nRecognition and reward for open research in research assessment is progressed as a strategic priority by members of senior management. External engagement ensures alignment to sector. Leadership in open research is seen and valued across the organisation, and includes researchers, research enablers and open research advocates.\n\n\nStrategy and planning\nThere is no open research strategy or plans to implement change.\nA strategic plan for open research has identified recognition and reward for open research in research assessment as an area for action. This objective is recognised in strategic action on research assessment reform.\nStrategic action on open research has progressed. Recognition and reward for open research across all key areas of research assessment is actioned by a stakeholder group against a strategic plan. Progress has been made against objectives.\nStrategic action on open research is well-developed and sustained. Recognition and reward for open research has been implemented in relevant policies and procedures. The implementation plan has been delivered and action is focused on monitoring, consolidating and embedding practice.\n\n\nCommunication and engagement\nThere is no communication about the recognition of open research in research assessment.\nSome information about recognition and reward for open research in research assessment has been communicated, but with little or no guidance, or active engagement.\nStrategic communications about recognition and reward for open research are part of an open research communication plan. Key stakeholders have been identified and engaged. Stakeholders have been able to learn about and contribute to changes in policy and procedure.\nWell-publicised information about recognition and reward for open research in research assessment policies and procedures is supplemented by strategic, consistent communications targeting key stakeholders and the wider community to raise awareness and promote good practice.\n\n\nPolicy and procedure\nRecognition and reward for open research is not referenced in policies or procedures related to or involving the use of research assessment.\nRecognition and reward for open research is mentioned in some relevant policies and procedures, but on a limited basis and with little evidence of integration or effective use.\nRecognition and reward for open research is included in most relevant policies, with evidence of effective integration into practice.\nRecognition and reward for open research is included in all relevant policies and procedures. There is evidence of increasing effective use of open research criteria by candidates and assessors in research assessment activities. Policies are reviewed regularly.\n\n\nSupport, systems and processes\nThere is no operational implementation of recognition and reward for open research in research assessment.\nColleagues enabling open research provide some support for open research recognition and reward, without dedicated responsibilities, systems or processes.\nIn some research assessment activities, colleagues have defined responsibilities to support recognition and reward for open research, and there has been some development of supporting resources, systems and processes.\nColleagues have defined responsibilities to support recognition and reward for open research in relevant research assessment activities. Resources are allocated and supporting resources, systems and processes are well-developed and operating effectively.\n\n\nGuidance and training\nThere is no guidance or training on recognition and reward for open research in research assessment.\nSome guidance on recognition and reward for open research is provided for those involved in research assessment.\nGuidance and training on recognition and reward for open research is well-developed and made available to researchers, assessors and external candidates, as relevant. Resources are integrated into some processes and are promoted to staff. Training is encouraged for key staff members.\nGuidance and training on recognition and reward for open research is available for all relevant groups. It is systematically targeted at staff involved in research assessment, and integrated into auditable training and development frameworks and processes. There is widespread use of training.\n\n\nMonitoring and evaluation\nThere is no monitoring or evaluation of recognition and reward for open research in research assessment.\nThere has been some observation of practice with respect to recognition and reward for open research in research assessment.\nMeasures are defined and reported to monitor use of open research criteria in research assessment, with some operational support. Data capture developments in some practices and/or identify areas for targeting.\nThere is systematic collection and reporting of data on use of open research criteria in research assessment, with allocated operational support. Progress is monitored and evaluated across the institution, identifying and targeting areas for improvement.\n\n\nResearch planning\nOpen research is not considered in institutional and individual research planning activities.\nThere is some use of open research criteria in institutional and individual research planning activities, but these are not fully aligned with institutional research and assessment strategies.\nOpen research criteria are defined and reported in institutional and individual research planning activities. Planning identifies open research objectives and links these to institutional strategy related to open research and recognition and reward.\nOpen research criteria are systematically used and reported in institutional and individual research planning activities. There is evidence of a sustained increase in setting and reporting against open research objectives. Strategic priorities related to open research inform institutional planning.",

    "text": "Delphine Doucet (Research and Scholarly Communications Librarian)\nSee Implementation guide section: Institutional Committment\n\n\nThe University of Sunderland is a teaching intensive institution; however, our research activity is growing and embracing the principles of open research. This aligns with the aim set out in our Strategic Plan 2020-2025 of being society-shaping and producing impactful research.\n\n\n\nAs with many institutions, these are early days for building an open research culture within the University of Sunderland. Change is being championed by our Pro Vice Chancellor of Research and Global Engagement, Professor Jo Crotty. As we start to consider how we can make meaningful reform to reward and recognition practices, we need to ensure institution-wide commitment for open research, which includes the need to educate colleagues on what open research is and why it matters.\n\n\n\nThe University has been a signatory of DORA since the academic year 2020/21 and has had an Open Access mandate since 2016. However, it was recognised that more was needed to embed open research practices in the University and that a stronger institutional commitment was necessary.\n\n\n\nThe first step the University undertook as part of its engagement with OR4 was to develop an Open Research Statement and a Responsible Use of Metrics Statement. The two statements were drafted by the Research and Scholarly Communication Librarian. These drafts were developed by consulting similar statements available via other institutions’ websites such as Glasgow, Edge Hill, Sheffield Hallam, and Leeds universities. The drafts were then reviewed and amended by members of the academic community and staff in the Research and Graduate School team. The two statements were presented at our Research and Innovation Committee in June 2024 and after further amendments were adopted in September 2024.\nIn addition to these statements of intent, we wanted to support and develop an understanding of open research in the institution. Using some funding from UKRI’s Enhancing Research Culture grant, the Research and Scholarly Communication Team (Libraries and Learner Development) led a small project to create training material to support staff and PGR understanding of open research. Our aim was to raise awareness, develop open research knowledge and skills in our research community, and align these with the University’s Open Research and Responsible Metrics statements.\nThe funds were used to employ four PhD students to create training materials about open research to raise the baseline of understanding in the institution. The work also aimed to start an emerging advocacy strand and network for the institution about open research.\n\n\n\nThe four students created a range of materials to help advocate for open research (see resources below).\nThe materials were released in September 2024 via a Research Network meeting. The response was positive and staff who attended the meeting were keen to engage with the resources. In October 2024 we used International Open Access Week as another opportunity to promote the resources through the University Library Research and Scholarly Communications Blog, linking these clearly to our Open Research Statement. The four blog posts have been viewed regularly since they were posted with c.200 views between October 2024 and March 2025, and an increase in conversations with staff for the Research and Scholarly Communication Team (Libraries and Learner Development).\nIn January 2025, a series of internal releases about the two statements were published with an offer of support and training delivered by the Research and Scholarly Communication Team (Libraries and Learner Development). Each communication aimed to highlight specific elements of open research practices and link it with responsible metrics. Together they gathered c. 370 views.\n\nOpen Research and Responsible Use of Metrics\nOpen Research and Open Access\nOpen Research and Open Research Data\nOpen Research and Research Copyright\nOpen Research, pre-prints and preregistration\nOpen Research and engaged research\nOpen Research and open software\nResponsible Metrics and assessing your research\n\nContributing to our work of awareness raising, we co-organised with the universities of Durham, Newcatle, Northumbria and Teesside an Open Research Week under the banner of the Universities for North East England.\nFurther work will follow shortly with the release of a survey on open research (inspired by a survey of open research practices led at the University of Bristol) to understand training requirements for our staff. The survey was developed by one of our student interns.\nIn the context of the current challenging financial situation for the HE sector and the demands placed on members of the University, it is certainly harder to communicate the importance of open research because it is just one of many completing pressures. The counterbalance is the REF and the opportunity to use PCE statements as a lever for research culture change. Activity is starting in this area. In particular, newly-appointed faculty research leads and unit of assessment leads will be key contacts and champions in supporting the adoption of open research practices.\n\n\n\n\nContext is everything - every institution is on a different path to open research and every step it takes to build understanding of open research practices is a step in the right direction\nChanging reward and recognition practices for open research is not something that can be done in silo, institutions must prioritise its benefits and advocate its importance to ensure institutional understanding and engagement.

Where these activities are separately led, leaders in both areas must accept and agree on the objectives to be achieved, in order for implementation to be effective.\nRecognition and reward for open research in research assessment is relatively undeveloped. There is a risk that its importance will not be appreciated or factored into activity. It will be essential to have an informed and empowered advocate who is able to ensure open research is within scope of activity and given due weight.\nLeadership can be demonstrated by those in positions of influence, as research leaders and managers and senior members of professional services; as professional services colleagues who might support good practice though the provision of services, guidance and training; and as informal or nominated advocates of open research.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNo Action\nEmerging\nEvolving\nSustained\n\n\n\n\nThere is no senior strategic leadership for open research or responsible research assessment.\nThere are identified senior strategic leads for open research and responsible research assessment.

These can be considered when you develop an institutional action plan.\n\n\n\nNominate and empower a member of senior management or professional services with responsibility for strategic action to develop open research culture and practice.\nNominate and empower a senior strategic lead for responsible research assessment.\nIdentify recognition and reward for open research as a priority for strategic action.\n\n\n\n\n\nEvidence activity by senior strategic leads for open research and responsible research assessment and engagement with relevant stakeholders.

This person will represent the institutional commitment to open research and act as a strong advocate for the open research interest. They must be sufficiently informed about open research and convinced of its importance to be a strong advocate. This will be essential where research assessment reform activity is separately led, and discussion may be required to ensure that recognition and reward for open research is within scope of activity and given appropriate weight.\nAn open research lead is likely to have greatest impact when this is a role with authority to instigate institution-wide change e.g., a PVC for Research, Dean, senior professional services manager, or someone at a similar level. The role may be most effective where there are defined responsibilities and accountability, for example to develop, implement and report on the progress of a plan of strategic action to increase open research culture and practice in the institution. For members of the UKRN, the role could fit well with that of Institutional Lead: members of the UKRN are required to appoint a senior academic to this role, with responsibility for research improvement and research integrity, reporting to the PVC for Research (or their equivalent). The Institutional Lead role is expected to make a minimum commitment of 1 day per week (0.2FTE). Stakeholders within institutions that lack an open research lead and are not currently members of UKRN may be able to use the case for membership as a vehicle for securing senior management leadership for open research.\nAction to develop open research culture and practice in the institution would ideally be undertaken by a group convened for the purpose under the senior lead for open research and comprising representatives of key stakeholder groups, including the academic community and relevant professional services. But the existence and scope of such a group, and its actions, will vary across institutions according to research priorities and available resources.\n\n\n\nImplementation of recognition and reward for open research will require leadership in promoting the need for change within the institution, engaging key stakeholders and the wider community to secure buy-in and manage resistance, and in managing a stakeholder group tasked with delivering established objectives.\nImplementation may sit at the intersection of otherwise separate activities to address research assessment reform and to develop open research culture and practice. These activities may be undertaken by separate groups under the direction of different senior leads within the institution. Where this is the situation, the lead for open research will need to make the case for recognition of open research within institutional assessment and ensure that there is agreement with the lead for research assessment reform on the objectives to be achieved and the means by which they will be achieved. This agreement may have been established through the process of developing institutional commitments to open research and research assessment reform.\n\n\n\nWhile the focus of senior leadership roles will be on activity within the institution, there will also be opportunities for external engagement. Leadership here may help to promote alignment in policies for recognition of open research within research assessment, at the level of national assessment (i.e. through the REF), by funders when assessing researchers and institutions for the award of grants, and between institutions, so that researchers are assessed by similar standards at all institutions. Representation in national fora such as the CoARA National Chapter (for CoARA members) and the OR4 community of practice afford opportunities to exchange knowledge and practice and to co-ordinate activities across the UK sector.\n\n\n\nResearch leaders and managers have a role to play in developing a research environment that incentivises researchers to use open research practices, as well as in the specific promotion of recognition and reward for open research. According to their roles and institutional requirements they may do any of the following:\n\npromote the use of open research practices in the areas under their authority, including compliance with relevant policy expectations, such as those relating to open access publication and data sharing;\nset an example by demonstrating good open research practice in their own work and professional relationships;\nuse communication activities to highlight and celebrate the open research activities and outputs of colleagues;\nengage with and signpost to colleagues the professional services that provide support for open research, such as research publishing and research data management services;\nsupport researchers at all levels to develop their knowledge and skills through the training and support provided by the institution;\nuse research planning and internal review processes to identify and, if required, report on attainment of open research objectives at group or individual level, as relevant;\nmonitor activity and compliance, and take appropriate action in cases of non-compliance or poor practice, such as arranging for additional support or training;\nensure that activities involving the assessment of researchers under their authority (e.g. recruitment and probation, promotion, performance and development review, etc.) implement appropriate recognition and reward for open research.\n\n\n\n\nLeadership will also be required at different levels and in different places in the institution to champion the open research agenda, and specific activity to include recognition and reward for open research in research assessment. Champions may be:\n\nmembers of professional services who will support implementation: both those who provide open research support and training and have a strong investment in promoting open research practice, and others such as HR professionals who may have specific roles to play in implementing and promoting new policies and procedures;\nadvocates for good practice in research, who may be formally nominated in some capacity, or have some informal role. Examples include open research champions, UK Reproducibility Network Local Network Leads, etc.",

    "text": "A member of senior management with responsibility for developing open research culture and practice within the institution can develop and lead strategic action and act as a senior champion for open research. This person will represent the institutional commitment to open research and act as a strong advocate for the open research interest. They must be sufficiently informed about open research and convinced of its importance to be a strong advocate. This will be essential where research assessment reform activity is separately led, and discussion may be required to ensure that recognition and reward for open research is within scope of activity and given appropriate weight.\nAn open research lead is likely to have greatest impact when this is a role with authority to instigate institution-wide change e.g., a PVC for Research, Dean, senior professional services manager, or someone at a similar level. The role may be most effective where there are defined responsibilities and accountability, for example to develop, implement and report on the progress of a plan of strategic action to increase open research culture and practice in the institution. For members of the UKRN, the role could fit well with that of Institutional Lead: members of the UKRN are required to appoint a senior academic to this role, with responsibility for research improvement and research integrity, reporting to the PVC for Research (or their equivalent). The Institutional Lead role is expected to make a minimum commitment of 1 day per week (0.2FTE). Stakeholders within institutions that lack an open research lead and are not currently members of UKRN may be able to use the case for membership as a vehicle for securing senior management leadership for open research.\nAction to develop open research culture and practice in the institution would ideally be undertaken by a group convened for the purpose under the senior lead for open research and comprising representatives of key stakeholder groups, including the academic community and relevant professional services. But the existence and scope of such a group, and its actions, will vary across institutions according to research priorities and available resources.\n\n\n\nImplementation of recognition and reward for open research will require leadership in promoting the need for change within the institution, engaging key stakeholders and the wider community to secure buy-in and manage resistance, and in managing a stakeholder group tasked with delivering established objectives.\nImplementation may sit at the intersection of otherwise separate activities to address research assessment reform and to develop open research culture and practice. These activities may be undertaken by separate groups under the direction of different senior leads within the institution. Where this is the situation, the lead for open research will need to make the case for recognition of open research within institutional assessment and ensure that there is agreement with the lead for research assessment reform on the objectives to be achieved and the means by which they will be achieved. This agreement may have been established through the process of developing institutional commitments to open research and research assessment reform.\n\n\n\nWhile the focus of senior leadership roles will be on activity within the institution, there will also be opportunities for external engagement. Leadership here may help to promote alignment in policies for recognition of open research within research assessment, at the level of national assessment (i.e. through the REF), by funders when assessing researchers and institutions for the award of grants, and between institutions, so that researchers are assessed by similar standards at all institutions. Representation in national fora such as the CoARA National Chapter (for CoARA members) and the OR4 community of practice afford opportunities to exchange knowledge and practice and to co-ordinate activities across the UK sector.\n\n\n\nResearch leaders and managers have a role to play in developing a research environment that incentivises researchers to use open research practices, as well as in the specific promotion of recognition and reward for open research. According to their roles and institutional requirements they may do any of the following:\n\npromote the use of open research practices in the areas under their authority, including compliance with relevant policy expectations, such as those relating to open access publication and data sharing;\nset an example by demonstrating good open research practice in their own work and professional relationships;\nuse communication activities to highlight and celebrate the open research activities and outputs of colleagues;\nengage with and signpost to colleagues the professional services that provide support for open research, such as research publishing and research data management services;\nsupport researchers at all levels to develop their knowledge and skills through the training and support provided by the institution;\nuse research planning and internal review processes to identify and, if required, report on attainment of open research objectives at group or individual level, as relevant;\nmonitor activity and compliance, and take appropriate action in cases of non-compliance or poor practice, such as arranging for additional support or training;\nensure that activities involving the assessment of researchers under their authority (e.g. recruitment and probation, promotion, performance and development review, etc.) implement appropriate recognition and reward for open research.\n\n\n\n\nLeadership will also be required at different levels and in different places in the institution to champion the open research agenda, and specific activity to include recognition and reward for open research in research assessment. Champions may be:\n\nmembers of professional services who will support implementation: both those who provide open research support and training and have a strong investment in promoting open research practice, and others such as HR professionals who may have specific roles to play in implementing and promoting new policies and procedures;\nadvocates for good practice in research, who may be formally nominated in some capacity, or have some informal role. Examples include open research champions, UK Reproducibility Network Local Network Leads, etc.",

    "text": "Dr Stuart RF King (Research Quality and Culture Manager) and Dr Elizabeth Gadd (Head of Research Culture and Assessment)\nSee Implementation guide sections: Policy and procedure, Support, systems and processes, Guidance and training\n\n\nLoughborough University is a UK research-intensive institution with around 20,000 students and nearly 4,000 staff, including over 1,000 in research-active or research-enabling roles. It has a strong tradition in engineering and sport, alongside recognised strengths in science, business, social sciences, design, and the creative arts. With nine Schools across two campuses, Loughborough fosters a collegial community and prioritises responsible research.\n\n\n\nWe have introduced new internal guidance for research assessment at Loughborough called Evidence-Informed Output Narratives (EONs). Initially applied to academic promotions, there are plans to extend other research-active and research-enabling job families and assessment activities, such as appraisals. When preparing narrative statements as part of internal assessments, researchers can now draw on a weighted menu of evidence types, organised into three categories:\n\nEvidence of Contribution – to clarify the individual’s role where outputs have multiple authors or contributors;\nEvidence of Quality or Peer Validation – such as peer-review comments, external evaluations, or prizes;\nEvidence of Reach or Visibility – including citation counts, download statistics, audience numbers, and open-access links.\n\nOpenness is explicitly emphasised within the Reach or Visibility category: open-access availability, data sharing, and code repositories are all included as valid forms of evidence.\nEach School has scored the menu of evidence to reflect its own disciplinary practices, assigning weightings to indicate how each type of evidence is valued. Importantly, all Schools have classified open access to research outputs as ‘important’ or ‘very important’, reinforcing the University’s shared commitment to making research outputs discoverable, reusable, and accessible to diverse audiences.\n\n\n\nAs a signatory of both DORA and CoARA, Loughborough is committed to the responsible use of metrics across research and innovation. However, we recognised that traditional metrics were insufficient for capturing the full diversity of scholarly contributions—particularly in the Arts, Humanities, and some Social Sciences, where non-textual or practice-based outputs are more common. Early feedback from colleagues highlighted two persistent challenges:\n\nPromotion panel assessors were often required to assess applications outside their area of expertise, making it difficult for them to evaluate outputs fairly across disciplines.\nResearchers struggled to evidence the quality, visibility and impact of ‘non-textual’ or ‘practise-based’ outputs within existing assessment frameworks.\n\nWe began developing the Evidence-Informed Output Narratives (EONs) format in response. In parallel, broader changes to the promotion process were undertaken, and candidates started to be asked to provide narrative statements that their research profile was ‘clearly advancing’ using ‘a range of evidence’. However, there was still no clear guidance on what forms of evidence could be included or how they would be assessed. Evidence-informed Output Narratives evolved to fill this gap. The guidance offers a structured yet flexible framework to support disciplinary diversity and enable fairer, more informed decision-making.\n\n\n\nThe EONs approach was initially led on by Loughborough’s Head of Research Culture and Assessment, and later led by the Research Quality and Culture Manager. It was co-created with the research community to ensure disciplinary credibility and relevance, including significant input from Professor Stephen Rice and Professor Victoria Haines.\nWork began in 2021, using the SCOPE Framework for Research Evaluation (developed by INORMS) to shape the process. Following this five-stage model’s principle of ‘evaluating with the evaluated’, we worked closely with colleagues from the Schools of Social Sciences and Humanities, and Design and Creative Arts, as well as the Associate Deans for Research and Innovation across all nine Schools. Their input informed the structure of the guidance and the weighted menu of evidence.\nA small pilot was carried out in Autumn 2024 with ten recently promoted academics, identified through an open call from HR and with support from Associate Deans to ensure disciplinary breadth. Participants drafted an Evidence-Informed Output Narrative (EON) for one of their research outputs and completed a short survey. The pilot also enabled us to assess the potential impact of the approach and ensure that the guidance was fair, equitable and did not inadvertently disadvantage any group.\nFeedback was positive - especially from those working with non-traditional outputs, who found the guidance clearer and more supportive than previous approaches. The weighted evidence menu helped identify appropriate indicators. Researchers with conventional outputs also found the format, on average, at least as effective as the current process. Suggestions from participants led to the addition of clearer instructions and examples.\nWe also consulted a former Dean with promotion panel experience, who found the EONs suitable for review without needing major changes to the process or timelines.\nFollowing the pilot, the guidance was refined and officially incorporated into the 2025 promotion round as optional support. We are taking a phased approach, continuing to monitor use and gather feedback. Future use in appraisals is being explored.\nThe guidance is linked from HR’s academic promotions pages, and Associate Deans have been briefed. With the move to an annual promotions cycle, further communications are planned to support both candidates and assessors ahead of the next round.\n\n\n\nCoordinating with other changes to the promotions process was challenging. Working to integrate EONs into the promotion process was more complex than expected, likely due to the perceived high-stakes nature of changes to promotions and the additional scrutiny involved.\nSecuring participants for the pilot was difficult; while we would have liked a larger group, we are grateful to those who took part and provided valuable feedback. Achieving adequate representation across disciplines required persistent follow-up.\nSome pilot participants found the early guidance too abstract and requested clearer, discipline-specific examples. To address this, we incorporated practical examples such as EONs for a creative arts portfolio and a journal article into the guidance.\nWe maintained close communication with Associate Deans for Research and Innovation, using their local knowledge to support engagement. More regular communication with services like HR was needed to keep aligned and respond to shifting priorities.\nEarly co-design helped build trust and ensured the framework was relevant across disciplines. Piloting with near-real promotion cases provided reassurance and revealed practical, addressable issues that might otherwise have been overlooked.\n\n\n\n\nEngage broadly and early: Involve academic colleagues from all disciplines—especially those with non-textual or practice-based outputs—through co-design workshops or focus groups to ensure the approach meets diverse needs.\nUse the SCOPE Framework: Apply the SCOPE framework when developing new assessment approaches to help identify values, explore options and mitigate potential unintended consequences.\nPilot the approach: Test new frameworks with a small, representative cohort before full implementation, gathering feedback from both applicants and reviewers.\nProvide concrete examples: Offer sample narratives for each discipline to illustrate how different evidence types can be selected and contextualised.\nCommunicate throughout: Maintain regular dialogue with Departments and Schools, HR, and senior leadership to secure buy-in and keep the process on track.\n\n\n\n\nEvidencing the quality and visibility of your research – Explains how to prepare a narrative statement for internal research assessment.\nTemplate for weighted menu of evidence – Lists and scores types of evidence for others to use\nSCOPE Framework for Research Evaluation – Summary of the INORMS framework used to guide development.\nPilot Feedback Survey – Used to gather participant views on the draft guidance and evidence menu.\n© Loughborough University.

    "text": "The EONs approach was initially led on by Loughborough’s Head of Research Culture and Assessment, and later led by the Research Quality and Culture Manager. It was co-created with the research community to ensure disciplinary credibility and relevance, including significant input from Professor Stephen Rice and Professor Victoria Haines.\nWork began in 2021, using the SCOPE Framework for Research Evaluation (developed by INORMS) to shape the process. Following this five-stage model’s principle of ‘evaluating with the evaluated’, we worked closely with colleagues from the Schools of Social Sciences and Humanities, and Design and Creative Arts, as well as the Associate Deans for Research and Innovation across all nine Schools. Their input informed the structure of the guidance and the weighted menu of evidence.\nA small pilot was carried out in Autumn 2024 with ten recently promoted academics, identified through an open call from HR and with support from Associate Deans to ensure disciplinary breadth. Participants drafted an Evidence-Informed Output Narrative (EON) for one of their research outputs and completed a short survey. The pilot also enabled us to assess the potential impact of the approach and ensure that the guidance was fair, equitable and did not inadvertently disadvantage any group.\nFeedback was positive - especially from those working with non-traditional outputs, who found the guidance clearer and more supportive than previous approaches. The weighted evidence menu helped identify appropriate indicators. Researchers with conventional outputs also found the format, on average, at least as effective as the current process. Suggestions from participants led to the addition of clearer instructions and examples.\nWe also consulted a former Dean with promotion panel experience, who found the EONs suitable for review without needing major changes to the process or timelines.\nFollowing the pilot, the guidance was refined and officially incorporated into the 2025 promotion round as optional support. We are taking a phased approach, continuing to monitor use and gather feedback. Future use in appraisals is being explored.\nThe guidance is linked from HR’s academic promotions pages, and Associate Deans have been briefed. With the move to an annual promotions cycle, further communications are planned to support both candidates and assessors ahead of the next round.",

    "text": "Coordinating with other changes to the promotions process was challenging. Working to integrate EONs into the promotion process was more complex than expected, likely due to the perceived high-stakes nature of changes to promotions and the additional scrutiny involved.\nSecuring participants for the pilot was difficult; while we would have liked a larger group, we are grateful to those who took part and provided valuable feedback. Achieving adequate representation across disciplines required persistent follow-up.\nSome pilot participants found the early guidance too abstract and requested clearer, discipline-specific examples. To address this, we incorporated practical examples such as EONs for a creative arts portfolio and a journal article into the guidance.\nWe maintained close communication with Associate Deans for Research and Innovation, using their local knowledge to support engagement. More regular communication with services like HR was needed to keep aligned and respond to shifting priorities.\nEarly co-design helped build trust and ensured the framework was relevant across disciplines. Piloting with near-real promotion cases provided reassurance and revealed practical, addressable issues that might otherwise have been overlooked.",

A number of policies and procedures will be affected – those related to recruitment, probation, promotion, performance and development review, and possibly others.

These can be considered when you develop an institutional action plan.\n\n\n\nInclude some mention of open research and open research criteria in some key policies, e.g. for promotion, although the broader policy framework and supporting procedures, training, etc. may not yet be developed.\n\n\n\n\n\nDevelop and publish a research assessment policy or statement aligned to the Principles of the Agreement on Reforming Research Assessment, which includes a commitment to recognise and reward open research, with definition of open research and reference to an open research statement or policy.\nIdentify relevant policies and procedures involving the assessment of researchers e.g., those concerning recruitment, probation, promotion, performance and development review, and engage policy owners to discuss and agree required policy, including support and resource requirements.\n\n\n\n\n\nEnsure that all relevant policies and procedures have been updated to integrate recognition and reward for open research consistent with institutional policy and open research policies.\nEnsure that policies and procedures are operating effectively and have been refined as necessary in response to feedback. Various routes should be available to provide feedback for substantive and iterative development of policy and procedure.\nReview policies and procedures on a regular basis to align with developments in open research practice.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRecognition and reward for open research will be relevant to and require incorporation in a range of institutional policies and procedures, including those concerning recruitment, academic probation, promotion and professorial review, performance and development review, and any other processes involving research appraisal and reward allocation. It will be important to ensure that institutional systems of reward and recognition are aligned and consistent between themselves.\nWe believe the most effective way to achieve this alignment and ensure consistency across relevant policies is to adopt an institutional research assessment policy to which other policies can be linked. Such a policy would set out the general principles of research assessment, which would include expectations and responsibilities related to open research. Relevant provisions could then be adopted into policies and procedures that involve the assessment of research or researchers.\nThis is not necessarily the only option for implementing relevant policy provisions. They might also be progressively integrated into existing policies, for example, beginning with the academic promotion policy, then moving on to recruitment and probation, performance and development review, etc. This may be a more practicable option in some institutions.\n\n\n\nThe emphasis on open research as a dimension of research that should be considered in research assessment is relatively recent. (This is discussed in the Introduction.) Where institutions have adopted policies relating to research assessment, so far these have mostly been focused on publications and the responsible use of publication metrics.1 There is consequently both a need to update existing research assessment policies and a lack of established models for policies that reflect a broader concept of responsible research assessment, especially any that include explicit recognition of open research.\nThere is also the challenge of articulating open research expectations and requirements fairly, and in a meaningful and realistic way, within any research assessment policy, given that current awareness and practice on the part of researchers are at a relatively low level. Any policy must take account of various factors, in particular:\n\nresearchers will come from different institutional and cultural backgrounds, which will have influenced the degree to which they are aware of and have had opportunity to use open research practices;\nthe relevance of open research practices and benchmarks will vary by discipline and type of research. Some disciplines may have more advanced cultures of data sharing or using pre-registration than others; relevant of open research practices and policy expectations will depend on the type of research: data sharing expectations cannot apply where research has not involved collecting data. Policy expectations must be formulated so that they can be applied in ways that are meaningful for specific disciplines and, within disciplines, for specific types of research;\nthe existence and scale of any track record in open research will depend on the career stage of the researcher and their employment history, which may include career breaks, or employment in industry or other areas that have not provided opportunities to use open research practices.\n\nInstitutions will approach the development of policy, and the inclusion of open research within it, in different ways, but it will be important to ensure the process of policy development is inclusive and the end result embodies the values of the institution. The SCOPE Framework for Research Evaluation developed by the Institutional Network of Research Management Societies (INORMS) is an excellent practical model that can be used to support the an inclusive process of policy co-development and implementation. It includes a number of case studies that demonstrate how different institutions have used the Framework to develop research assessment policies.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n‘There was a need to make allowances for adjustments in Schools to support individual and discipline-specific requirements and approaches. This was particularly true for open research practices, which are currently adopted to different degrees across disciplines. Similarly, career stage was a consideration, as earlier-career researchers tend to be more familiar with open research practices than senior researchers.’ University of Bristol\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhile the focus here is primarily on academic researchers, we believe that contribution to open research should be recognised and rewarded wherever and by whomever it is made. (This is discussed in the Introduction.) Institutional policies should recognise the collaborative nature of much research, and should enable non-academic contributors to research, such as data scientists, technicians and reesarch softare engineers, to be recognised and rewarded appropriately.\nWhere policy is developed, effort should be made to ensure non-academic contributors and research enablers have the opportunity to provide input. The insitution may participate in initiatives that support better recognition and career development for research enablers, such as the Technician Commitment, or members of staff may be engaged in professional communities that advocate for increased recognition, such as the Society of of Research Software Engineering. Representatives for such commitments and initiatives may be key stakeholders to engage in the policy development process.\n\n\n\nPolicies and procedures that would need to take account of open research criteria include those relating to recruitment, probation, promotion, and professorial review, performance and development review, and other forms of reward and recognition, e.g. awards of institutional funding and other prizes.\nThe process of updating policies and procedures is likely to require a substantive collaborative development and consultation phase and could be driven by a research assessment reform group, an existing group with authority in these areas, or an empowered institutional lead. There may be discussion with policy owners over the precise nature of the changes, how and by whom any support requirements will be met, and the provision of additional resources to support implementation. It will be important to reach agreement on these matters if the policy is to be implemented effectively. It will also be necessary to ensure there is appropriate reference to open research expectations/requirements in any update of related policy and procedure documents, and guidance and support are signposted. For example, an academic promotion framework may need to update its criteria to include specification of open research, with information for both promotion panels and candidates providing links to any relevant policy information, guidance and training.\n\n\n\nAcademic promotion and professorial review policies customarily define assessment frameworks in which a number of assessment criteria are identified, usually under broad categories such as Academic citizenship and leadership, Research, and Teaching and learning.\nThere have been some efforts to create models of academic assessment frameworks in which open science is a defining dimension of academic activity and assessment. These have been European initiatives, where ‘open science’ may encompass not just open research activities and outputs, but other knowledge-related activities such as innovation, the creation of impact, public engagement, and teaching and supervision. These models of academic assessment frameworks may be of use to institutions that are planning or undertaking a review of academic development and assessment pathways and frameworks.\nIn such frameworks, recognition can be given not just for practising open research directly, but for contributing to a culture in which open research is enabled and practised, for example by delivering training in open research practices,2 by using open research products in teaching, or by developing or curating infrastructure that supports open research, e.g. community data standards. These frameworks are consistent with the ambition of the Coalition for Advancing Research Assessment to expand the range of activities and outputs recognised in research assessment.\nIn 2017 the EU report ‘Evaluation of research careers fully acknowledging Open Science practices’3 proposed an Open Science Career Assessment Matrix (OS-CAM) in which open science is a guiding principle, and the full spectrum of open science practices, including open access to publications, open data, open peer review, research integrity, citizen science and stakeholder engagement, is taken into account. In the proposed framework all aspects of a researcher’s career, output and activities are included in the assessment, and all outputs and activities are assessed on the basis of their degree of openness.\nThe OPUS project, which began in 2022, has built on the foundation laid by OS-CAM to produce a comprehensive researcher assessment framework which includes an open science dimension designed to support recognition and reward for open science practices. The framework structures indicators in four categories of activities, for Research, Education, Leadership and Valorisation, thus providing an ‘open’ lens with which to view the full range of an academic’s activities. The framework is being tested and refined in collaboration with pilot institutions. It uses a modular design so that the framework can be customised to meet the requirements of the individual institution.\n\n\n\nIncluding open research in the University of Bristol’s Academic Promotions Framework",

The University has been a signatory of DORA since the academic year 2020/21 and has had an Open Access mandate since 2016. However, it was recognised that more was needed to embed open research practices in the University and that a stronger institutional commitment was necessary… In addition to these statements of intent, we wanted to support and develop an understanding of open research in the institution. Using some funding from UKRI’s Enhancing Research Culture grant, the Research and Scholarly Communication Team (Libraries and Learner Development) led a small project to create training material to support staff and PGR understanding of open research. Our aim was to raise awareness, develop open research knowledge and skills in our research community, and align these with the University’s Open Research and Responsible Metrics statements.’ University of Sunderland\n\n\n\n\n\nIncreasing numbers of UK universities, and indeed institutions globally, are adopting public statements of commitment to the principles and aims of open research.1 Their function is to provide the strategic commitment to develop a culture of open research and the high-level framework under which activity and policies (such as those on open access and data sharing) can sit. The statement should be in alignment with (and may reference) the University’s research strategy. Reference to statements such as the UKRI position on open research and the UNESCO Recommendation on Open Science can serve to emphasise alignment to the sector.\nThe statement should include a commitment to recognise and reward open research practice, and reference an institutional statement or policy on responsible research assessment where this exists.\nMembers of the institution formulating this commitment will need to reflect on how open research is understood within the context of the institutional mission, and how it contributes to the advancement of that mission.\n\n\n\nWith momentum for research assessment reform building globally, many institutions are reviewing or planning to review their research assessment policies and procedures. This may entail publishing or refreshing a statement of commitment to the agenda of research assessment reform.\nMany institutions have already signed the San Francisco Declaration on Research Assessment (DORA) and will have made a commitment to improve research and researcher assessment within their institutions. As of 7th November 2022, DORA asked signatory institutions to ‘share a public statement detailing their commitment to DORA and responsible research assessment to their communities’.2\nWhether or not institutions are DORA signatories, there is a case for signing the Agreement on Reforming Assessment to begin the process of establishing specific commitments and a timetable of reform. Signatories commit to develop and share with CoARA within one year of signing the Agreement an action plan for reviewing or developing criteria, tools and processes in line with the core Commitments set out in the Agreement. They also agree to regularly demonstrate progress against this action plan, with a touch point within five years of signing the Agreement.\nInstitutions that receive funding from the Wellcome Trust are also required to publish on their website a commitment to the use of responsible research assessment aligned with the DORA and CoARA principles. They are expected to have a plan in place for implementing the principles, and for monitoring and reporting on implementation.\nA statement of institutional commitment to research assessment reform should include an undertaking to integrate open research criteria into systems of reward and recognition, in line with the emphasis placed on open research/open science in the Agreement and more recent discussions of responsible research assessment. It should also reference the statement of institutional commitment to open research, where this exists.\n\n\n\nAside from commitment explicitly based on or subscribing to the main research assessment reform initiatives, institutions might consider making supporting commitments, e.g.:\n\nThe More than Our Rank initiative provides an opportunity for academic institutions to highlight the problematic nature of league table rankings.\nThe Barcelona Declaration on Open Research Information asks institutions to commit to making openness the default for research information, and to challenge the status quo in which large amounts of research information are locked in proprietary profit-making infrastructures.\nThe Hidden REF 5% Manifesto encourages institutions to commit to submit at least 5% of their submissions to REF 2029 as non-traditional research outputs, to promote better representation for the range of research contribution roles and ‘non-traditional’ research outputs.\n\nWhether or not institutions sign up to all these commitments, discussion of them can be useful ways to highlight areas of practice in need of reform and to consider ways in which they might be addressed.\n\n\n\nPublishing commitments to open research or research assessment reform will be a collective effort, with stakeholder groups led by senior colleagues. Any commitment will be ineffective if the effort is not made to build the coalition that will implement it and if ownership and accountability are not built in. The process of developing an institutional statement will offer an opportunity to engage stakeholders through consultation, and to secure support for their achievement through strategic actions. Care should be taken to ensure that relevant stakeholder groups are represented in the process of developing and consulting on institutional commitments (including, for example, early career researchers and professional services colleagues) and that statements, once adopted, are communicated to the research community. Institutional commitments will need to be signed off at a high level, and there will need to be appropriate ownership of, and accountability for, delivering against the commitments.\nStrategic activities related to development of open research and research assessment reform may have separate origins within the institution and may be undertaken by separate groups under different leadership. Where this is the case, it will be important to ensure that their activities are co-ordinated on the common ground of reward and recognition for open research, and that there is agreement about objectives and the means of attainment. The process of developing and consulting on institutional statements should ensure this co-ordination and agreement take place.\nAgreement on the relevance and place of open research within research assessment cannot be taken for granted. One advantage of signing up to the Agreement on Reforming Research Assessment is that by doing so the institution subscribes to the Core Commitment to ‘Recognise the diversity of contributions to, and careers, in research in accordance with the needs and nature of the research’. The purpose of this Commitment is to broaden the range of research activities and outputs recognised, to include inter alia ‘diverse outputs beyond journal publications’ and ‘practices that contribute to robustness, openness, transparency and the inclusiveness of research’.\n\n\n\nThe institution will need to demonstrate over time that aspirational commitments are being realised and incorporated into business as usual. Published commitments can identify senior leads and groups responsible for implementing them, and include action plans and updates on progress against milestones. Where there are specific reporting expectations associated with external commitments, such as those associated with membership of CoARA, these can be communicated within the institution.\nActivities and communications relating to institutional research strategy, environment and culture should be aligned to and reference institutional commitments. Policies and procedures will in due course integrate elements of the open research commitments that have been realised and may reference them, as may relevant guidance and training. Internal communication channels can be used to communicate the open research commitments to key stakeholders and the broader research community. Management structures can be used to ensure the commitments are applied and referenced as appropriate.",

A stakeholder analysis can help with this. It will largely overlap with the stakeholder analysis for research assessment reform, although there may be those with specific interests and expertise in open research who will need to be engaged, including:\n\nmembers of any stakeholder group overseeing strategic action related to open research;\nmembers of professional services who support open research, such as colleagues supporting open access and research data management and research software engineers, as well as those who may support procedures that will be affected, such as colleagues in HR;\nopen research advocates, such as UKRN Local Network Leads or those in other institutionally appointed champion roles, and individuals who have a profile as open research advocates.\n\n\n\n\nCommunications related to implementation of recognition and reward for open research are likely to be developed and managed as part of the communications plan for research assessment reform.\nKey phases of communication might be:\n\nsignalling intent and engaging key stakeholders: this phase might accompany the making of any institutional commitments, such as signing the Agreement on Reforming Research Assessment;\nconsultation or co-development with key stakeholders, for example, in relation to a draft research assessment policy, or proposed changes to academic promotion criteria;\npublication and promotion of policy, guidance and training;\nongoing communications to consolidate and embed changes, increase awareness, and ensure those affected are informed about expectations, requirements and support, using research leaders and managers, relevant research support functions, such as HR and open research support teams, and open research champions to target and amplify key messages;\nensuring there is representation of researchers’ interests on strategic oversight groups, so that there is a formal channel for feedback about policy and procedures, and providing inclusive mechanisms for review and amendment of policy.\n\nCommunications and engagement planning will need to take account of likely resistances and concerns.

    "text": "Main areas of activity\n\nIncluding open research objectives in research planning\nGiven the dominance of the research publication as the global currency of research, institutional planning objectives will remain largely focused on publications and will only practically engage with a greater diversity of outputs as the result of a sustained effort. The same planning framework will influence the definition of objectives for institutional research units (Schools, Departments, research divisions, research groups) and for individuals.\nResearch planning at institutional, unit and individual level has the power to define what is important to the institution, and to influence research practice. It can drive adoption and use of open research practices, and ensure that open research outputs have greater visibility within institutional systems that support the planning, management and ultimately the assessment of research. But planning strategy will need to be aligned and supported at all levels of the institution. There are likely to be challenges in ensuring consistency where planning activities are organised and managed at different levels by different stakeholders.\nResearch planning will be informed by research assessment expectations. Institutional-level research planning will be influenced by the eligibility and assessment criteria of the REF and the requirements of funders among other factors. These expectations will in turn inform planning and objectives for intra-institutional research units and for individual researchers. There will be policies and processes associated with these activities, which must be updated to take account of requirements and expectations related to recognition and reward for open research. Changes will need to be supported by communications with research leaders and managers, provision of guidance, and professional services support. Training may also need to be provided. Further information is provided in the Guidance and training section.\nAs it becomes easier to cite and provide access to a wider range of open research outputs by means of trustworthy research infrastructure and persistent identifiers, and to quantify aspects of their use by means of reliable indicators, they will acquire greater visibility within institutional systems. This will make it easier to specify measurable objectives related to them and to build institutional planning activities and services around them. In this way, open research objectives could be cascaded through the institution. For example:\n\nat an institutional level, research planning could set open research KPIs/objectives, e.g. to increase numbers of datasets deposited in repositories and cited from research publications. Information could be extracted from data availability statements associated with publications, although systems and workflows will be required to capture and analyse this information.\nsupport for open research is an aspect of the ‘People, Culture and Environment’ element of the REF, and the ‘Contribution to Knowledge and Understanding’ element will enable institutions to evidence a greater diversity of research activities and outputs.1 REF planning can anticipate these requirements and work with the institution’s open research leadership and support to begin developing its strategy for addressing them;\nresearch units could be asked to define open research objectives appropriate to the disciplines and types of research they cover, to work with their researchers to increase relevant activities and outputs, and to report progress upwards. Dedicated professional services support could be provided to boost capacity, for example through tailored training sessions or workshops, and one-to-one expert support for specific practices, such as pre-registration, data sharing and software publishing. Objectives could also be set to build open research capacity in strategic areas through recruitment and promotion;\nwithin the wider frame of institutional and local open research objectives, individual research planning objectives can be tailored to the researcher’s specific context and aligned to open research criteria for promotion. This might involve development of individual research plans focusing on the acquisition of open research skills or the production and communication of open research outputs in addition to publications.\n\nThese requirements may inform design and use of systems for collecting and managing open research information, as discussed in the Support, systems and processes guide.\nPDF TEST 20 JUNE. 23 JUNE",

    "text": "The Recognising and rewarding open research toolkit consists of two main components:\n\na maturity framework and self-assessment tool that institutions can use to assess their maturity in the implementation of relevant policies and procedures, to support internal discussion and planning, and to measure ongoing progress;\nan implementation guide consisting of an introduction and sections linked to corresponding action areas in the maturity framework, providing detailed practical guidance to support assessment, planning and progress. The guide is illustrated with case studies that exemplify different aspects of institutional activity. A glossary of key terms is included.\n\nThe maturity framework and guide are organised in nine action areas under three themes, as follows:\nStrategy and leadership\n\nInstitutional commitment\nLeadership\nStrategy and planning\n\nImplementation\n\nCommunication and engagement\nPolicy and procedure\nSupport, systems and processes\nGuidance and training\n\nManaging progress\n\nMonitoring and evaluation\nResearch planning\n\n\n\nEach of the nine action areas represents an aspect of institutional activity through which recognition and reward for open research can be operationalised. These different aspects are interrelated, and must all be addressed to some degree if recognition and reward for open research is to be effectively implemented.\nAn assessment undertaken using the maturity framework and the self-assessment tool will generate an overall picture of institutional maturity across all nine action areas at a given point in time. It can enable a group of stakeholders to establish a baseline, identify and focus on the target level of maturity in each action area, plan the means by which this target can be attained, and in due course measure progress.\nThe implementation guide can be used to develop a shared understanding of the rationale for recognising and rewarding open research practice and to explore different aspects of implementation in greater depth, in order to support informed planning and implementation.\nThe toolkit is organised broadly according to the logic of implementation, which might begin with institutional commitments to open research and research assessment reform and conclude with effective integration of recognition and reward for open research as part of researcher assessment practices. The logic is not necessarily linear: in practice, actions in different areas may be more or less co-ordinated, and may be concurrent or undertaken at different times and in different sequences. Institutions will have different starting points and different objectives. The framework is not meant to prescribe a single route to a fixed destination, but to facilitate planning and implementation adapted to the needs of the institution."

Implementation progress can be reported to the institutional sponsor group. This may also be the group to which ongoing progress post-implementation will be reported.\nGiven the number and variety of researcher assessment activities that an institution undertakes, a representative sampling approach may be necessary. For example, relevant activities in a small number of Schools or Departments might be observed during a defined time period. The same activities in the same areas could then be observed during similar time periods at later dates. These may be the areas in which changes to procedures are piloted before being rolled out more widely. The selection should ensure that a suitable variety of disciplinary cultures is represented, for example by including sciences, social sciences and arts and humanities disciplines. On a longer-term basis a random sampling approach across all areas of institutional activity might be used.\nIt will be necessary to define the information of relevance and the methods of data collection by which current practice can be characterised and progress measured. There is a wide range of open research indicators which could be considered. In respect of recognition and reward for open research, examples of methods by which data might be obtained include:\n\nanalysis of a sample of job advertisements for open research criteria/keywords;\nanalysis of a sample of applications for e.g. the presence of open research keywords, citation of outputs other than peer-reviewed publications;\ndocumentation of review processes, for example by the chair of a panel.

For a researcher to be able to evidence open research practices, they must have used those practices, and given the current low levels of adoption, many researchers may have little evidence to offer. But the progressive evolution of open research culture and practice will in due course increase the volume of evidence available, and the knowledge that open research is recognised and rewarded by an institution will be one important factor among others driving that increase in volume.\nIt will be important to be able to identify non-compliance and sub-optimal practice, so that remedial action can be put in place, for example by means of changes to procedures, targeted communications, conversations as part of performance and development review, and support or training.",

    "text": "Adrian Bell (Associate Pro-Vice-Chancellor Research), Robert Darby (Research Data Manager), Wanda Tejada (Research Excellence Framework and Research Planning Manager)\nSee Implementation guide section: Strategy and planning\n\n\nThe University of Reading is a broad-based research-intensive university, with over 19,000 students and almost 4,000 members of staff.\n\n\n\nIn the period 2017-21 members of the University Library and a core group of senior research stakeholders began to develop a shared understanding of drivers related to responsible research assessment and open research and started to articulate strategic objectives. During this time the University published statements on the responsible use of metrics (2018) and open research (2019), established a Committee on Open research and Research Integrity (CORRI, 2019), and sought to develop the conversation about open research within our research community by various means, including conference-style events and open research award competitions. At this stage strategic direction was still maturing, and actions did not necessarily entail significant operational change. There was evidence of continuing uncritical use of metrics such as the Journal Impact Factor and the H-index in promotion and recruitment activities. Open research culture was still in a very early stage of evolution.\nFrom 2021 the University instigated more organised strategic activity under the sponsorship of CORRI to develop open research culture and practice and to align the University to the principles of responsible research assessment. Open Research Action Plans (ORAP) were created and adopted for the periods 2021-23 and 2024-2029, and an Implementation Group was formed to undertake delivery. (The current ORAP is published on the University’s Open Research web pages.)\nThe first ORAP identified implementation of recognition and reward for open research as an objective. To address both this requirement and the need for broader research assessment reform, CORRI established a Research Assessment Working Group (2021). The Working Group led the University to become an early member of the Coalition for Advancing Research Assessment (CoARA) and has set out a five-year plan of work in its CoARA Action Plan. It has built stakeholder engagement, drafted a Research Assessment Policy, and laid the foundations for policy adoption and implementation over the period to 2028. One of the key principles of the proposed policy is that ‘Assessment should recognise openness and reproducibility in research’.\n\n\n\nWe recognise that the integration of open research into research practice requires long-term cultural and behavioural change. Many researchers do not currently use relevant open research methods, even where they are required by University policy, as in the case of data sharing. We believe that researcher assessment policies can be powerful enablers of desirable behaviours and can contribute to changes in practice and culture over the long term.\nWe have developed and championed this view in the University with reference to discussions in the sector, including the EU’s Open Science Career Assessment Matrix (OS-CAM, 2017), the LERU white paper, Open Science and its role in universities: a roadmap for cultural change (2018), and the UNESCO Recommendation on Open Science (2021). The last of these states: ‘Assessment of scientific contribution and career progression rewarding good open science practices is needed for operationalization of open science’.\nThe gathering momentum for research assessment reform, marked by publication of the Agreement on Reforming Research Assessment and the formation of CoARA in 2022, provided a timely stimulus. The Agreement highlights in its ‘Diversity, inclusiveness and collaboration’ principle the importance of considering open research activities and outputs within the framework of responsible research assessment.\nThe REF has also focused institutional attention. Principles of responsible research assessment and recognition of the growing importance of open research informed REF 2021; guidance on the REF 2029 People, Culture and Environment element indicates that institutional support for open research and responsible research assessment will feature more strongly still. This provides a compelling narrative within which stakeholders can understand and support the work being undertaken.\n\n\n\nThe Research Assessment Working Group reports to CORRI, which itself reports to University Senate. It is chaired by Associate Pro-Vice-Chancellor for Research Professor Adrian Bell, who also leads the ORAP Implementation Group. Several individuals are members of both groups. This ensures both groups are co-ordinated and that integrating recognition and reward for open research is a central objective of research assessment reform.\nThe Working Group includes representation from the academic community at different levels (a Head of School, a Research Division Lead, a senior academic, and an early career researcher) and professional services. Members of the Library’s Research Engagement team provide expertise in open research and responsible research assessment; the REF Planning Manager ensures alignment with REF preparation; an HR Partner provides valuable operational insight and influence. Academic members have experience of recruitment, promotion and academic probation, and ensure that the interests of researchers at different career stages and in different disciplines are represented.\nThe Working Group has drafted a Research Assessment Policy and created a policy co-development framework informed by the SCOPE principles. Members of the group provide paths for engagement with key stakeholders and wider communities: throughout Spring 2025 different members will be leading co-development workshops or meetings with different stakeholder groups. In addition to engagements with specific stakeholders, workshops open to the research community will enable participation from across disciplines, career stages and levels of responsibility. A self-assessment workshop using the OR4 project’s maturity framework is planned for later in the year as an additional co-development element focused on recognition and reward for open research.\nWe are aiming for adoption of a University Research Assessment Policy later in 2025. Strategic activities and communications linked to phases of policy implementation will grow awareness in the research community of responsible research assessment and the role of open research. Guidance and training will be developed to support the practical use of open research criteria within researcher assessments, and implementation will be monitored and evaluated on an ongoing basis. Activities are co-ordinated with the wider ORAP project to build open research capability across the institution. The initial implementation phase will continue until 2028 and will be following by ongoing consolidation, as practices are progressively integrated into business as usual.\n\n\n\nLack of models for integrating open research into research assessment: While a number of UK universities have policies on the responsible use of publication metrics, there are currently few policies that articulate a broader framework of research assessment encompassing open research activities and outputs. We found a small number of universities that specified some open research criteria in their promotions policies, but these were quite minimal and we could find no evidence of how the criteria were used in practice. We found a few isolated examples of job descriptions that mentioned Open Research, but no evidence of an institutional policy-based approach to including open research criteria in research-based job specifications.\nPractical application of recognition and reward for open research is therefore largely uncharted territory. We hope OR4 can help by sharing emerging practice; as may initiatives to build practical models that institutions can use, such as the OPUS project, which is developing and piloting Open Science indicators.\nLimited awareness and understanding of the role of open research in research assessment: Awareness, understanding and acceptance of the place of open research in research assessment is very low across the institution, and indeed within the sector as a whole. Education is needed at all levels: for those in institutions who must lead in developing and implementing policy; for those undertaking assessment activities, such as members of promotion panels, so that they can use open research criteria appropriately; and for researchers, so that they can effectively develop and apply open research practices in their own work and evidence relevant activities and outputs in an assessment context. Policy adoption will only be the start: it will take many years for practice to mature and for the impacts to work themselves out.\nEngagement with the OR4 project has enabled a core group of stakeholders to understand and champion the place of open research in responsible research assessment. We hope to progressively disseminate understanding and practical knowledge across the institution as we implement policy and the associated communications, guidance, training, and operational supports.\n\n\n\nIdentify strategic levers: Recognition and reward for open research can intersect with a number of different strategic activities within an institution, such as to develop open research culture and practice, to undertake research assessment reform, and to prepare the institution for the REF. These can be useful strategic levers when seeking to develop the case or gain the buy-in of key stakeholders who may provide leadership or play an enabling role. It is important to ensure that objectives related to open research are clearly identified in the scope of related activities.\nCo-develop with your stakeholders: It is essential to ensure that all key stakeholder groups are identified and representative stakeholders are engaged. We created a co-development framework informed by the SCOPE principles to ensure that policy is developed and implemented inclusively and that it reflects our shared values as a research community. This framework recognises that effective implementation of policy requires co-ownership and an understanding of its impacts in a variety of processes and contexts. Our CoARA Action Plan includes a table of key stakeholders by role in an Appendix.\n\n\n\nUniversity of Reading Open Research Action Plan 2024-29.

We believe that researcher assessment policies can be powerful enablers of desirable behaviours and can contribute to changes in practice and culture over the long term.\nWe have developed and championed this view in the University with reference to discussions in the sector, including the EU’s Open Science Career Assessment Matrix (OS-CAM, 2017), the LERU white paper, Open Science and its role in universities: a roadmap for cultural change (2018), and the UNESCO Recommendation on Open Science (2021). The last of these states: ‘Assessment of scientific contribution and career progression rewarding good open science practices is needed for operationalization of open science’.\nThe gathering momentum for research assessment reform, marked by publication of the Agreement on Reforming Research Assessment and the formation of CoARA in 2022, provided a timely stimulus. The Agreement highlights in its ‘Diversity, inclusiveness and collaboration’ principle the importance of considering open research activities and outputs within the framework of responsible research assessment.\nThe REF has also focused institutional attention. Principles of responsible research assessment and recognition of the growing importance of open research informed REF 2021; guidance on the REF 2029 People, Culture and Environment element indicates that institutional support for open research and responsible research assessment will feature more strongly still. This provides a compelling narrative within which stakeholders can understand and support the work being undertaken.",

    "text": "The Research Assessment Working Group reports to CORRI, which itself reports to University Senate. It is chaired by Associate Pro-Vice-Chancellor for Research Professor Adrian Bell, who also leads the ORAP Implementation Group. Several individuals are members of both groups. This ensures both groups are co-ordinated and that integrating recognition and reward for open research is a central objective of research assessment reform.\nThe Working Group includes representation from the academic community at different levels (a Head of School, a Research Division Lead, a senior academic, and an early career researcher) and professional services. Members of the Library’s Research Engagement team provide expertise in open research and responsible research assessment; the REF Planning Manager ensures alignment with REF preparation; an HR Partner provides valuable operational insight and influence. Academic members have experience of recruitment, promotion and academic probation, and ensure that the interests of researchers at different career stages and in different disciplines are represented.\nThe Working Group has drafted a Research Assessment Policy and created a policy co-development framework informed by the SCOPE principles. Members of the group provide paths for engagement with key stakeholders and wider communities: throughout Spring 2025 different members will be leading co-development workshops or meetings with different stakeholder groups. In addition to engagements with specific stakeholders, workshops open to the research community will enable participation from across disciplines, career stages and levels of responsibility. A self-assessment workshop using the OR4 project’s maturity framework is planned for later in the year as an additional co-development element focused on recognition and reward for open research.\nWe are aiming for adoption of a University Research Assessment Policy later in 2025. Strategic activities and communications linked to phases of policy implementation will grow awareness in the research community of responsible research assessment and the role of open research. Guidance and training will be developed to support the practical use of open research criteria within researcher assessments, and implementation will be monitored and evaluated on an ongoing basis. Activities are co-ordinated with the wider ORAP project to build open research capability across the institution. The initial implementation phase will continue until 2028 and will be following by ongoing consolidation, as practices are progressively integrated into business as usual.",

    "text": "Lack of models for integrating open research into research assessment: While a number of UK universities have policies on the responsible use of publication metrics, there are currently few policies that articulate a broader framework of research assessment encompassing open research activities and outputs. We found a small number of universities that specified some open research criteria in their promotions policies, but these were quite minimal and we could find no evidence of how the criteria were used in practice. We found a few isolated examples of job descriptions that mentioned Open Research, but no evidence of an institutional policy-based approach to including open research criteria in research-based job specifications.\nPractical application of recognition and reward for open research is therefore largely uncharted territory. We hope OR4 can help by sharing emerging practice; as may initiatives to build practical models that institutions can use, such as the OPUS project, which is developing and piloting Open Science indicators.\nLimited awareness and understanding of the role of open research in research assessment: Awareness, understanding and acceptance of the place of open research in research assessment is very low across the institution, and indeed within the sector as a whole. Education is needed at all levels: for those in institutions who must lead in developing and implementing policy; for those undertaking assessment activities, such as members of promotion panels, so that they can use open research criteria appropriately; and for researchers, so that they can effectively develop and apply open research practices in their own work and evidence relevant activities and outputs in an assessment context. Policy adoption will only be the start: it will take many years for practice to mature and for the impacts to work themselves out.\nEngagement with the OR4 project has enabled a core group of stakeholders to understand and champion the place of open research in responsible research assessment. We hope to progressively disseminate understanding and practical knowledge across the institution as we implement policy and the associated communications, guidance, training, and operational supports.",

    "section": "",
    "text": "This introductory section explains the rationale for recognising and rewarding open research in the assessment of researchers, with reference to the open research and responsible research assessment agendas that have evolved in recent years. It can be used as a reference text for a group of stakeholders undertaking a self-assessment exercise using the OR4 maturity framework, and to inform engagement in support of planned action, such as the development of business cases, consultation or co-development with stakeholders, and communications with the wider research community. It can serve to establish a shared understanding of open research and responsible research assessment, and an awareness of the drivers for strategic action in these areas in the higher education and research sector.\n\n\nThere are key reasons why open research practices are important in the context of researcher assessment:\n\nOpen practices support and demonstrate research integrity and quality, by providing transparency about research methods and evidence, and enabling independent verification or reproduction of findings\nOpen practices generate a variety of outputs in addition to research publications, such as datasets, software and digital resources, and facilitate their re-use, so maximising opportunities to generate further value\nThe broader range of activities and outputs associated with open research practices enables a more rounded assessment of a researcher’s activities and outputs than is possible where publications are the primary or exclusive focus of assessment.\n\nA researcher who uses open research practices better demonstrates and enables verification of the quality of their research, maximises the potential of their research to generate value, and is able to provide a more representative picture of the totality of their research and related activities.\nOperationalisation of open research incentives and expectations in the researcher assessment activities of research-performing organisations will signal that open practices are considered to be an essential part of how research is carried out. It will power the adoption of open research practices by researchers and lead to improvements in research integrity, quality and impact.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOpen research and its benefits\n\n\n\n\n\nUKRI describes open research in the following terms:\n\nOpen research, also widely referred to as open science, relates to how research is performed and how knowledge is shared based on the principle that research should be as open as possible. It also enables research to take advantage of digital technology.\nTransparency, openness, verification and reproducibility are important features of research and innovation. Open research helps to support and uphold these features across the whole lifecycle of research – improving public value, research integrity, reuse and innovation.\nOpen research also helps to support collaboration within and across disciplines. It is integral to a healthy research culture and environment.\n\nOpen research can be situated in the context of a global discourse about open knowledge and openness in academic practice (which often uses the term open science). In the open knowledge paradigm, ‘openness’ is integral to the practices by which research is conducted, communicated, evaluated, validated and instrumentalised. Open research practice is held to have a direct relationship to research integrity (through transparency of methods and outputs), research quality (through the use of evidentiary and reproducible practices), sustainability (through use of appropriate standards and formats, preservation infrastructure, and persistent identifiers), and reach and impact (through the accessibility and re-usability of outputs).\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe principles of open research have gained widespread acceptance in recent years, and the importance of openness in research is acknowledged by governments, funders, and research-performing institutions. The 2021 adoption by the UNESCO member states of its Recommendation on Open Science marks a significant milestone in this respect. Many public research funders and most research institutions in the UK have established policies on open access to research publications and the management and sharing of research data, which are fundamental open research practices. More recently, some institutions have adopted statements in support of open research, endorsing the principles and aims of open research and encouraging use of relevant open research practices.\nBut open research policies and statements are as yet relatively unintegrated into institutional research strategy and planning and actual research practice. Beyond high levels of compliance with open access mandates, driven in large part by the requirements of the UK’s Research Excellence Framework (REF), there is little evidence of widespread open research practice. Rates of effective data sharing remain low.1 Open research practices are for the most part not incentivised and rewarded; nor, with the exception of open access publication, are they systematically monitored or enforced, either by institutions or by the funders of research.\n\n\n\nAt present, very few institutional recruitment, promotion, probation and appraisal frameworks include reference to open research criteria or outputs other than research publications; standards and practices for evidencing a track record in open research are not well-established; and there is a lack of guidance, training and support related to open research for researchers and staff involved in assessment. In consequence, use of open research practices is rarely evidenced or considered in the formal assessment activities, and is in large part unmonitored by institutions.2\nWith momentum for research assessment reform building globally, there is an opportunity to integrate open research into revised researcher assessment frameworks and practices. Universities play a critical role in the systems of academic reward and recognition. It is in their power to include open research criteria in their recruitment specifications, probation objectives and promotion frameworks, performance and development review processes, and research planning activities. By this means researchers can be incentivised and supported to build a track record in open research and to present that track record in an assessment activity, while assessment practices can recognise and give credit for a record of open research practice. This will drive increased adoption of open research practices, and, in time, bear fruit in the recruitment and promotion of staff who are recognised for working in ways that increase the integrity, quality and impact of the institution’s research output.\n\n\n\nThe history of research assessment reform can be characterised in terms of an evolution from an agenda focused almost exclusively on the use of publication-based metrics towards a broader framework of responsible research assessment (Figure 1). This broader, more instrumental agenda considers research assessment as a means of enabling the best researchers to flourish, promoting diversity and inclusion, and supporting the production of high-quality research – in short, as a means to engineer research culture. Within this agenda, there has been growing attention to the role of open research practices in relation to research assessment.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 1: Milestones in the history of research assessment reform\n\n\n\nAlthough the San Francisco Declaration on Research Assessment (DORA, 2013), the founding text of research assessment reform, was primarily concerned with research publications and related metrics, its second recommendation adumbrates a broader assessment agenda:\n\nFor the purposes of research assessment, consider the value and impact of all research outputs (including datasets and software) in addition to research publications, and consider a broad range of impact measures including qualitative indicators of research impact, such as influence on policy and practice.\n\nWhile DORA mentions datasets and software as examples of other research outputs, it lacks the broader concept of open research that has developed in the years since its publication, and does not provide guidance on how other types of output might be included and assessed. The Leiden Manifesto and the Metric Tide report (both published in 2015) were similarly focused on the use of publication metrics.\nWith the more recent emergence of a broader framework of responsible research assessment,3 there has been increased attention to open research. A white paper from the League of European Universities (LERU) published in 2018 recommended that universities ‘endeavour to integrate Open Science dimensions in their HR and career frameworks as an explicit element in recruitment, performance evaluation and career advancement policies’.4 Also in 2018, the European Universities Association published the ‘EUA Roadmap on Research Assessment in the Transition to Open Science’, which argued:\n\nToday, research assessment and reward systems generally do not reflect important Open Science contributions, such as curating and sharing datasets and collections, documenting and sharing software (source code), or devoting time and energy to high-quality peer review. New approaches to research assessment that take into account Open Science contributions need to be identified and thoroughly discussed by academic communities.5\n\nThe ‘Hong Kong Principles for assessing researchers’ (2020) call for assessment to develop a much broader picture of a researcher’s contributions to research and society. It identifies as one of its five principles to ‘Reward the practice of open science (open research)’, and it makes a strong connection between research transparency and research integrity.6 The UNESCO Recommendation on Open Science (2021) also enjoins member states to remove barriers to open science relating to research and career evaluation and awards systems, stating: ‘Assessment of scientific contribution and career progression rewarding good open science practices is needed for operationalization of open science’.\nIn the Agreement on Reforming Research Assessment, published in 2022 by the Coalition for Advancing Research Assessment (CoARA), ‘openness’ is recognised as being integral to the practices by which research is conducted, communicated and validated, and is identified as a key dimension of research assessment. Under the ‘Quality and impact’ principle of research assessment it states: ‘Openness of research, and results that are verifiable and reproducible where applicable, strongly contribute to quality’. Under the principle ‘Diversity, inclusiveness and collaboration’, signatories agree to:\n\nConsider… the full range of research outputs, such as scientific publications, data, software, models, methods, theories, algorithms, protocols, workflows, exhibitions, strategies, policy contributions, etc., and reward research behaviour underpinning open science practices such as early knowledge and data sharing as well as open collaboration within science and collaboration with societal actors where appropriate.\n\n\n\n\nThe greater emphasis on open research in the research assessment reform agenda is relatively recent, and national and institutional research assessment policies have so far reflected a prevailing focus on publications and the responsible use of publication metrics. In a survey undertaken by the OR4 project in 2023, 44 or 73% of 60 UK institutions stated that they had a responsible research assessment statement or policy. The majority of these were focused on the responsible use of publication metrics.7 In scope and terminology many of these statements follow and reference DORA and the Leiden Manifesto.\nThe almost exclusive focus on the assessment of research publications is understandable, given their prominence in the systems of academic recognition and reward. In REF 2021, of 185,353 outputs submitted, 180,509 or 97.4% fell into the main academic publications categories A-E (including authored and edited books, book chapters, journal articles and conference contributions). 154,826 outputs or 83.5% of the total were journal articles. The number of research data sets and databases submitted was 31; the number of software outputs was 11 (Figure 2).8\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 2: REF 2021 submitted outputs by output type\n\n\n\nThis heavily skewed distribution is the focus of the Hidden REF initiative, which emerged in the runup to the 2021 REF. This campaign highlighted the lack of representation in submissions for non-academic research contributors (such as data scientists, technicians and research software engineers) and for ‘non-traditional’ outputs (i.e. other than publications). Now that the UK is on track for REF 2029, the Hidden REF is campaigning on a 5% manifesto: a target for HEIs to submit at least 5% of non-traditional research outputs. This will be a challenging target to meet, given that in REF 2021 only 2.4% of non-traditional outputs were submitted.\nBut the landscape is beginning to change, and institutions will need to develop policies that better align to the principles of responsible research assessment and that are more representative of the full diversity of research and research-related activities and outputs.\n\n\n\nContribution to open research should be recognised and rewarded wherever and by whomever it is made. Institutional policies and practices should be designed inclusively and should recognise the collaborative nature of much research.\nAs the Hidden REF campaign has highlighted, much research is collaborative in nature and is contributed to and enabled by people in research-performing organisations who are not defined as academic researchers: data scientists, technicians, research software engineers, librarians and others. These contributory and enabling roles are often obscured in the reporting and assessment of research, given the prevailing focus on the publication as the representative research output, and on the academic researcher as the ‘author’ of the research.\nThe non-traditional outputs which lack visibility within systems of research assessment are also those to which non-academic staff typically most contribute, and as they are rarely named in publications, their role is often occluded in the formal reporting of research and its assessment. If non-traditional/open research outputs such as datasets and software are more visible in the reporting and assessment of research, the hidden contributors to research are also made more visible, and can be better recognised and rewarded in systems of employee assessment. Better recognition of contribution to research also supports a more diverse and inclusive research culture, and insitutional policies should be designed to enable appropriate recognition of contributions to research by non-academic staff.\n\n\n\nIn comparison to previous national assessment exercises, REF 2029 places greater emphasis on institutional research culture, including use of open research practices. Institutions can provide evidence of this in the People, Culture and Environment element, while the element Contribution to Knowledge and Understanding enables a greater diversity of research activities and outputs to be evidenced.9\nAs the national research assessment framework progressively assimilates open research objectives and assessment criteria, institutions will be obliged to conform, and to integrate open research into their own policies, systems and processes. The greater emphasis on open research in the 2029 REF is consistent with international developments, where other national research environments are also beginning to demonstrate greater alignment to the principles embodied in the Agreement on Reforming Research Assessment, and to identify open research as an important element of incentive and reward systems.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOpen research in other national research assessment frameworks\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn the Netherlands, a 2020 report by the National Programme on Open Science argued that reform was needed on three levels: at the level of national assessment, at the institutional level, and at the level of funding agencies. The roadmap for the Dutch Recognition and Rewards Programme identifies open science as a priority, and aims to ‘clarify how activities relating to open science and open education will be considered and/or prioritised as a topic of discussion in the development, assessment, appointment and promotion of staff’.10 Funding has since been ringfenced by the Dutch Research Council (NWO) to support implementation and stimulation of open science culture and practices.\nIn 2021 Universities Norway published NOR-CAM, a national research assessment framework that integrates open science principles in the assessment of academic results, activities and competencies. NOR-CAM was developed from the Open Science Career Assessment Matrix (OS-CAM) proposed by the EU Working Group on Rewards under Open Science in 2017.11\nThe Irish National Action Plan for Open Research published in 2022 calls for an alignment of research assessment with the principles of open research at both national and institutional level as part of action to establish a culture of open research, and proposes among other actions adoption of a modified OS-CAM model to the national context.12\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEnsuring the meaningful inclusion of open research objectives in institutional researcher assessment and aligned research planning activities at all levels in an institution is a long-term challenge requiring a sustained effort of leadership and co-ordinated activity. Challenges can be summarised as political, cultural, practical and operational.\n\n\nThere is substantial institutional investment in the prevailing publication-based model of research assessment. Institutional research KPIs and research elements of league table rankings are largely defined by publication metrics. Not all research leaders, managers, and researchers will agree that use of open research practices is a relevant criterion of research assessment, and securing buy-in to support policy adoption and implementation across relevant procedures may not be straightforward.\n\n\n\nThere will be similar challenges securing engagement and bringing about changes in practice among members of the research community at large, in their capacity as both assessors and subjects of research assessment. Many will not have fully integrated open research practices into their working methods and may have concerns they would be disadvantaged. Care will need to be taken that where open research criteria are introduced in assessment practices their use is fair and equitable. Ability to evidence open research practice will depend on the discipline and type of research, and the background and career stage of a researcher. Researchers may have lacked the training, means or opportunity to use open research practices. All of these factors will necessitate the provision of guidance, training and support in the context of sustained activity to develop and enable a culture of open research practice.\n\n\n\nThe institution will need an effective operating definition of open research. Researchers and those involved in the assessment of researchers will need to be equipped to identify activities and outputs that fall under that definition, to make an assessment of the degree to which an activity or output fulfils qualifying criteria, and to appraise the value of the activity or output within the context of the assessment as a whole. Each of these requirements presents its own challenges. Many academics may struggle to identify open outputs, or fail to appreciate the difference between, say, a dataset that is published on a project website without a licence and one that has been deposited in a data repository under an open licence and assigned a DOI.\nIt is also the case that for many open research outputs there is no pre-publication peer review, and standards of assessment may be difficult to define and apply across a variety of outputs, even of the same type, meaning that outputs often lack markers of certification. It is also often difficult to obtain reliable, comparable quantitative information about the citation and use of many open research outputs, although a number of initiatives are addressing the collection and use of open research indicators and metrics.\n\n\n\nThere will be the complex work of implementing changes to policies and procedures, and underpinning systems, processes and support, creating and delivering guidance and training, monitoring compliance with implemented policies and taking follow-up action as required. This may entail development of or addition to existing systems and processes. Systems for management and assessment of research are based in large part on research publications, which are well-defined entities that support citation, quantification and comparison. Mature infrastructure, systems and processes facilitate their dissemination, and the collection and processing of information about them. Models for the integration of open research into institutional research assessment and research planning are yet to be established; but if research assessment is to accommodate a wider range of activities and outputs, this will introduce complexity and additional operational demand.\nThe OR4 implementation guide addresses these aspects of implementation, with an emphasis on the political and cultural aspects in the earlier sections moving into the practical and operational aspects in the later sections.",

    "text": "There are key reasons why open research practices are important in the context of researcher assessment:\n\nOpen practices support and demonstrate research integrity and quality, by providing transparency about research methods and evidence, and enabling independent verification or reproduction of findings\nOpen practices generate a variety of outputs in addition to research publications, such as datasets, software and digital resources, and facilitate their re-use, so maximising opportunities to generate further value\nThe broader range of activities and outputs associated with open research practices enables a more rounded assessment of a researcher’s activities and outputs than is possible where publications are the primary or exclusive focus of assessment.\n\nA researcher who uses open research practices better demonstrates and enables verification of the quality of their research, maximises the potential of their research to generate value, and is able to provide a more representative picture of the totality of their research and related activities.\nOperationalisation of open research incentives and expectations in the researcher assessment activities of research-performing organisations will signal that open practices are considered to be an essential part of how research is carried out. It will power the adoption of open research practices by researchers and lead to improvements in research integrity, quality and impact.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOpen research and its benefits\n\n\n\n\n\nUKRI describes open research in the following terms:\n\nOpen research, also widely referred to as open science, relates to how research is performed and how knowledge is shared based on the principle that research should be as open as possible. It also enables research to take advantage of digital technology.\nTransparency, openness, verification and reproducibility are important features of research and innovation. Open research helps to support and uphold these features across the whole lifecycle of research – improving public value, research integrity, reuse and innovation.\nOpen research also helps to support collaboration within and across disciplines. It is integral to a healthy research culture and environment.\n\nOpen research can be situated in the context of a global discourse about open knowledge and openness in academic practice (which often uses the term open science). In the open knowledge paradigm, ‘openness’ is integral to the practices by which research is conducted, communicated, evaluated, validated and instrumentalised. Open research practice is held to have a direct relationship to research integrity (through transparency of methods and outputs), research quality (through the use of evidentiary and reproducible practices), sustainability (through use of appropriate standards and formats, preservation infrastructure, and persistent identifiers), and reach and impact (through the accessibility and re-usability of outputs).",

    "text": "The principles of open research have gained widespread acceptance in recent years, and the importance of openness in research is acknowledged by governments, funders, and research-performing institutions. The 2021 adoption by the UNESCO member states of its Recommendation on Open Science marks a significant milestone in this respect. Many public research funders and most research institutions in the UK have established policies on open access to research publications and the management and sharing of research data, which are fundamental open research practices. More recently, some institutions have adopted statements in support of open research, endorsing the principles and aims of open research and encouraging use of relevant open research practices.\nBut open research policies and statements are as yet relatively unintegrated into institutional research strategy and planning and actual research practice. Beyond high levels of compliance with open access mandates, driven in large part by the requirements of the UK’s Research Excellence Framework (REF), there is little evidence of widespread open research practice. Rates of effective data sharing remain low.1 Open research practices are for the most part not incentivised and rewarded; nor, with the exception of open access publication, are they systematically monitored or enforced, either by institutions or by the funders of research.",

    "text": "At present, very few institutional recruitment, promotion, probation and appraisal frameworks include reference to open research criteria or outputs other than research publications; standards and practices for evidencing a track record in open research are not well-established; and there is a lack of guidance, training and support related to open research for researchers and staff involved in assessment. In consequence, use of open research practices is rarely evidenced or considered in the formal assessment activities, and is in large part unmonitored by institutions.2\nWith momentum for research assessment reform building globally, there is an opportunity to integrate open research into revised researcher assessment frameworks and practices. Universities play a critical role in the systems of academic reward and recognition. It is in their power to include open research criteria in their recruitment specifications, probation objectives and promotion frameworks, performance and development review processes, and research planning activities. By this means researchers can be incentivised and supported to build a track record in open research and to present that track record in an assessment activity, while assessment practices can recognise and give credit for a record of open research practice. This will drive increased adoption of open research practices, and, in time, bear fruit in the recruitment and promotion of staff who are recognised for working in ways that increase the integrity, quality and impact of the institution’s research output.",

    "text": "The history of research assessment reform can be characterised in terms of an evolution from an agenda focused almost exclusively on the use of publication-based metrics towards a broader framework of responsible research assessment (Figure 1). This broader, more instrumental agenda considers research assessment as a means of enabling the best researchers to flourish, promoting diversity and inclusion, and supporting the production of high-quality research – in short, as a means to engineer research culture. Within this agenda, there has been growing attention to the role of open research practices in relation to research assessment.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 1: Milestones in the history of research assessment reform\n\n\n\nAlthough the San Francisco Declaration on Research Assessment (DORA, 2013), the founding text of research assessment reform, was primarily concerned with research publications and related metrics, its second recommendation adumbrates a broader assessment agenda:\n\nFor the purposes of research assessment, consider the value and impact of all research outputs (including datasets and software) in addition to research publications, and consider a broad range of impact measures including qualitative indicators of research impact, such as influence on policy and practice.\n\nWhile DORA mentions datasets and software as examples of other research outputs, it lacks the broader concept of open research that has developed in the years since its publication, and does not provide guidance on how other types of output might be included and assessed. The Leiden Manifesto and the Metric Tide report (both published in 2015) were similarly focused on the use of publication metrics.\nWith the more recent emergence of a broader framework of responsible research assessment,3 there has been increased attention to open research. A white paper from the League of European Universities (LERU) published in 2018 recommended that universities ‘endeavour to integrate Open Science dimensions in their HR and career frameworks as an explicit element in recruitment, performance evaluation and career advancement policies’.4 Also in 2018, the European Universities Association published the ‘EUA Roadmap on Research Assessment in the Transition to Open Science’, which argued:\n\nToday, research assessment and reward systems generally do not reflect important Open Science contributions, such as curating and sharing datasets and collections, documenting and sharing software (source code), or devoting time and energy to high-quality peer review. New approaches to research assessment that take into account Open Science contributions need to be identified and thoroughly discussed by academic communities.5\n\nThe ‘Hong Kong Principles for assessing researchers’ (2020) call for assessment to develop a much broader picture of a researcher’s contributions to research and society. It identifies as one of its five principles to ‘Reward the practice of open science (open research)’, and it makes a strong connection between research transparency and research integrity.6 The UNESCO Recommendation on Open Science (2021) also enjoins member states to remove barriers to open science relating to research and career evaluation and awards systems, stating: ‘Assessment of scientific contribution and career progression rewarding good open science practices is needed for operationalization of open science’.\nIn the Agreement on Reforming Research Assessment, published in 2022 by the Coalition for Advancing Research Assessment (CoARA), ‘openness’ is recognised as being integral to the practices by which research is conducted, communicated and validated, and is identified as a key dimension of research assessment. Under the ‘Quality and impact’ principle of research assessment it states: ‘Openness of research, and results that are verifiable and reproducible where applicable, strongly contribute to quality’. Under the principle ‘Diversity, inclusiveness and collaboration’, signatories agree to:\n\nConsider… the full range of research outputs, such as scientific publications, data, software, models, methods, theories, algorithms, protocols, workflows, exhibitions, strategies, policy contributions, etc., and reward research behaviour underpinning open science practices such as early knowledge and data sharing as well as open collaboration within science and collaboration with societal actors where appropriate.",

    "text": "The greater emphasis on open research in the research assessment reform agenda is relatively recent, and national and institutional research assessment policies have so far reflected a prevailing focus on publications and the responsible use of publication metrics. In a survey undertaken by the OR4 project in 2023, 44 or 73% of 60 UK institutions stated that they had a responsible research assessment statement or policy. The majority of these were focused on the responsible use of publication metrics.7 In scope and terminology many of these statements follow and reference DORA and the Leiden Manifesto.\nThe almost exclusive focus on the assessment of research publications is understandable, given their prominence in the systems of academic recognition and reward. In REF 2021, of 185,353 outputs submitted, 180,509 or 97.4% fell into the main academic publications categories A-E (including authored and edited books, book chapters, journal articles and conference contributions). 154,826 outputs or 83.5% of the total were journal articles. The number of research data sets and databases submitted was 31; the number of software outputs was 11 (Figure 2).8\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 2: REF 2021 submitted outputs by output type\n\n\n\nThis heavily skewed distribution is the focus of the Hidden REF initiative, which emerged in the runup to the 2021 REF. This campaign highlighted the lack of representation in submissions for non-academic research contributors (such as data scientists, technicians and research software engineers) and for ‘non-traditional’ outputs (i.e. other than publications). Now that the UK is on track for REF 2029, the Hidden REF is campaigning on a 5% manifesto: a target for HEIs to submit at least 5% of non-traditional research outputs. This will be a challenging target to meet, given that in REF 2021 only 2.4% of non-traditional outputs were submitted.\nBut the landscape is beginning to change, and institutions will need to develop policies that better align to the principles of responsible research assessment and that are more representative of the full diversity of research and research-related activities and outputs.",

Institutional policies and practices should be designed inclusively and should recognise the collaborative nature of much research.\nAs the Hidden REF campaign has highlighted, much research is collaborative in nature and is contributed to and enabled by people in research-performing organisations who are not defined as academic researchers: data scientists, technicians, research software engineers, librarians and others. These contributory and enabling roles are often obscured in the reporting and assessment of research, given the prevailing focus on the publication as the representative research output, and on the academic researcher as the ‘author’ of the research.\nThe non-traditional outputs which lack visibility within systems of research assessment are also those to which non-academic staff typically most contribute, and as they are rarely named in publications, their role is often occluded in the formal reporting of research and its assessment. If non-traditional/open research outputs such as datasets and software are more visible in the reporting and assessment of research, the hidden contributors to research are also made more visible, and can be better recognised and rewarded in systems of employee assessment. Better recognition of contribution to research also supports a more diverse and inclusive research culture, and insitutional policies should be designed to enable appropriate recognition of contributions to research by non-academic staff.",

    "text": "In comparison to previous national assessment exercises, REF 2029 places greater emphasis on institutional research culture, including use of open research practices. Institutions can provide evidence of this in the People, Culture and Environment element, while the element Contribution to Knowledge and Understanding enables a greater diversity of research activities and outputs to be evidenced.9\nAs the national research assessment framework progressively assimilates open research objectives and assessment criteria, institutions will be obliged to conform, and to integrate open research into their own policies, systems and processes. The greater emphasis on open research in the 2029 REF is consistent with international developments, where other national research environments are also beginning to demonstrate greater alignment to the principles embodied in the Agreement on Reforming Research Assessment, and to identify open research as an important element of incentive and reward systems.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOpen research in other national research assessment frameworks\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn the Netherlands, a 2020 report by the National Programme on Open Science argued that reform was needed on three levels: at the level of national assessment, at the institutional level, and at the level of funding agencies. The roadmap for the Dutch Recognition and Rewards Programme identifies open science as a priority, and aims to ‘clarify how activities relating to open science and open education will be considered and/or prioritised as a topic of discussion in the development, assessment, appointment and promotion of staff’.10 Funding has since been ringfenced by the Dutch Research Council (NWO) to support implementation and stimulation of open science culture and practices.\nIn 2021 Universities Norway published NOR-CAM, a national research assessment framework that integrates open science principles in the assessment of academic results, activities and competencies. NOR-CAM was developed from the Open Science Career Assessment Matrix (OS-CAM) proposed by the EU Working Group on Rewards under Open Science in 2017.11\nThe Irish National Action Plan for Open Research published in 2022 calls for an alignment of research assessment with the principles of open research at both national and institutional level as part of action to establish a culture of open research, and proposes among other actions adoption of a modified OS-CAM model to the national context.12",

    "text": "Ensuring the meaningful inclusion of open research objectives in institutional researcher assessment and aligned research planning activities at all levels in an institution is a long-term challenge requiring a sustained effort of leadership and co-ordinated activity. Challenges can be summarised as political, cultural, practical and operational.\n\n\nThere is substantial institutional investment in the prevailing publication-based model of research assessment. Institutional research KPIs and research elements of league table rankings are largely defined by publication metrics. Not all research leaders, managers, and researchers will agree that use of open research practices is a relevant criterion of research assessment, and securing buy-in to support policy adoption and implementation across relevant procedures may not be straightforward.\n\n\n\nThere will be similar challenges securing engagement and bringing about changes in practice among members of the research community at large, in their capacity as both assessors and subjects of research assessment. Many will not have fully integrated open research practices into their working methods and may have concerns they would be disadvantaged. Care will need to be taken that where open research criteria are introduced in assessment practices their use is fair and equitable. Ability to evidence open research practice will depend on the discipline and type of research, and the background and career stage of a researcher. Researchers may have lacked the training, means or opportunity to use open research practices. All of these factors will necessitate the provision of guidance, training and support in the context of sustained activity to develop and enable a culture of open research practice.\n\n\n\nThe institution will need an effective operating definition of open research. Researchers and those involved in the assessment of researchers will need to be equipped to identify activities and outputs that fall under that definition, to make an assessment of the degree to which an activity or output fulfils qualifying criteria, and to appraise the value of the activity or output within the context of the assessment as a whole. Each of these requirements presents its own challenges. Many academics may struggle to identify open outputs, or fail to appreciate the difference between, say, a dataset that is published on a project website without a licence and one that has been deposited in a data repository under an open licence and assigned a DOI.\nIt is also the case that for many open research outputs there is no pre-publication peer review, and standards of assessment may be difficult to define and apply across a variety of outputs, even of the same type, meaning that outputs often lack markers of certification. It is also often difficult to obtain reliable, comparable quantitative information about the citation and use of many open research outputs, although a number of initiatives are addressing the collection and use of open research indicators and metrics.\n\n\n\nThere will be the complex work of implementing changes to policies and procedures, and underpinning systems, processes and support, creating and delivering guidance and training, monitoring compliance with implemented policies and taking follow-up action as required. This may entail development of or addition to existing systems and processes. Systems for management and assessment of research are based in large part on research publications, which are well-defined entities that support citation, quantification and comparison. Mature infrastructure, systems and processes facilitate their dissemination, and the collection and processing of information about them. Models for the integration of open research into institutional research assessment and research planning are yet to be established; but if research assessment is to accommodate a wider range of activities and outputs, this will introduce complexity and additional operational demand.\nThe OR4 implementation guide addresses these aspects of implementation, with an emphasis on the political and cultural aspects in the earlier sections moving into the practical and operational aspects in the later sections.",

    "section": "",
    "text": "Marcus Munafò (Associate Pro Vice Chancellor for Research Culture) and Jon Gausden (Senior People Development Partner)\nSee Implementation guide section: Policy and procedure\n\n\nThe University of Bristol is a research-intensive University, with over 29,000 students and employing approximately 9,000 staff. The University has a reputation for academic excellence and delivering world-leading research.\n\n\n\nA review of promotion and progression in 2017 included recommendations to review the promotion criteria for Associate Professor and Professor, which resulted in a new Academic Promotions Framework (APF) that launched in the 2020-2021 academic year. The APF looks to nurture individual and team excellence through clear descriptions of the full range of contributions and achievements that are valued by our institution. This exercise resulted in the specific inclusion of open research practices as an example of the contributions recognised by the APF.\nThe APF provides four categories for applicants for promotion to demonstrate their achievements against: (1) Research (2) Education (3) Engagement & Impact (4) Leadership & Citizenship. Each has different criteria intended to cover the range of expectations and experiences across academic pathways, and the diversity of staff that work at the University.\nThe Research category captures what it takes to build our position as one of the world’s leading research-intensive universities. Criterion R-1 (Research Outputs) goes beyond just publications and other formal ways of presenting research findings, and explicitly includes open research outputs.\nFor an individual to be recognised for demonstrating open research outputs within the R-1 criterion, they must evidence: ‘Producing open research outputs as appropriate by adopting good practice in, for example, sharing data and code, sharing materials, sharing digital outputs, publishing preprints and pre-registering study protocols’.\n\n\n\nAs a founding member of UKRN, and lead organisation on the UKRN Open Research Programme, we recognised the need to demonstrate sectoral leadership to incentivise uptake of open research practices. Through the Research Improvement Group (now Research Culture Committee), chaired by Professor Marcus Munafò as UKRN Institutional Lead for Bristol, we liaised with those undertaking work on the development of a new Academic Promotions Framework.\nThe aim of the Academic Promotions Framework programme was to create an academic career path that is challenging, rewarding and inclusive, and which enables all academic staff to have the opportunity to reach their full potential.\nIn order to achieve this, the University needed to recognise and reward the full range of contributions and achievements that are valued by the institution in ways that are transparent, accessible and sustainable. At the same time, our role in UKRN and our long history of sectoral leadership on open research practices meant that the Academic Promotion Framework programme presented an opportunity to embed incentives to promote uptake of these practices.\n\n\n\nThe Deputy Vice Chancellor and Provost was the senior sponsor of the Academic Promotion Framework programme, and chaired a Programme Board made up of senior stakeholders across the institution. Having a senior sponsor for the change was imperative to promote the strategic importance of creating the APF, and in navigating resistance to the change in the process.\nThe facilitators and Programme Managers of the change were the Academic Staff Development team, operating as part of the Academic Career Development Programme. The University’s commitment to external agreements such as DORA and the Concordat on Open Research Data also established a basis for including open research practices: ‘the production of open research data should be acknowledged formally as a legitimate output of the research process and should be recognised as such by employers… in contributing to an individual’s professional profile in relation to promotion’.\nProfessor Marcus Munafò worked with members of the Programme Board and Academic Staff Development team to argue for the inclusion of open research practices in the Academic Promotions Framework, and developing the corresponding wording.\nThose involved in the Programme Board were:\n\nDeputy Vice-Chancellor and Provost\nChief People Officer\nDirector of People and Organisational Development\nUCU Representatives\nAcademic Representatives (Research, Educational and Leadership Improvement)\nEarly Career Academic Representatives (Post-Doctoral Researcher and Lecturer)\nStaff Engagement Group Representative\nHead of Academic Staff Development\n\nAs the concept and practical resources for the Academic Promotions Framework evolved, there was also significant consultation across the institution for feedback. This included (but was not limited to) the following:\n\nHeads of School across all Faculties\nDeans and Pro Vice Chancellors across all Faculties.\nSchool Managers across all Faculties\nHR Business Partnering and Central HR Operations teams\nEDI Team\nReward and Recognition Teams from Organisational Development\nPeople Development\nTrade Unions\n\nFor the Academic Promotions Framework to be adopted into practice, other changes were required, such as establishing a Faculty Promotions Committee for each Faculty.\nIn particular, narrative writing workshops for building a promotion case within the Academic Promotions Framework were set up to help applicants understand the criteria and how to demonstrate that these had been met. This provided staff with the means and understanding for them to be recognised and rewarded appropriately, via a promotions case, both in general and specifically in relation to the inclusion of open research practices in their case if appropriate.\nIn the development of the Academic Promotion Framework, its concept was shared within the consultation groups (see above). This was via focus groups and bespoke presentations, led by the Academic Career Development Programme.\nThe finalised versions of the Academic Promotions Framework are available to both internal colleagues and externally to the wider public via the University of Bristol website. As the APF versions evolved, this too was updated. The links to the Academic Promotions Framework, and associated guidance documentation were shared via internal bulletins, and by relevant line managers, School and Faculty staff and Heads of HR Business Partnering, as their colleagues prepared their promotion cases.\nThe Academic Promotions Framework launched in time for the 2020/2021 promotions cycle for Associate Professor/Professor grades, and extended to Research/Teaching Associates through to Senior Lecturer/Senior Research Fellow grades in time for the 2021/2022 academic year. Shortly after the launch of the APF, the opportunity to use it to embed incentives for open research practices was recognised and pursued. The open research elements of the Academic Promotions Framework were promoted via the Research Improvement Group and through related activities such as the Open Research Prize.\n\n\n\nThere was a need to make allowances for adjustments in Schools to support individual and discipline-specific requirements and approaches. This was particularly true for open research practices, which are currently adopted to different degrees across disciplines. Similarly, career stage was a consideration, as earlier-career researchers tend to be more familiar with open research practices than senior researchers.\nPromotion is a topic which intersects several others across the institution. For effective changes to be made to the benefit of individuals and the institutional strategy, there must be meaningful consultation with all those who would be potentially impacted.\nThe iterations that result from this consultation are made most effective when driven by a governance structure with clear accountability and responsibility of roles, working towards clearly defined objectives and timelines.\nThese issues are particularly salient in the context of open research practices, which are variably understood and engaged with across, for example, disciplines and career stage, meaning that the criteria needed to be sufficiently broad and flexible to accommodate this.\n\n\n\n\nSenior Sponsorship is essential, and to provide direction and demonstrate institutional commitment.\nClear governance structures for decision making are required, including a clear Responsibility, Accountability, Consulted and Informed (RACI) model for the delivery of the project.\nThe inclusion of open research practices requires consideration of differences across, for example, disciplines and career stages, so that the relevant criteria are sufficiently broad and flexible.\nIt is essential to have a full Equity Diversity and Inclusion impact assessment conducted and continuously reviewed throughout the project, and post-implementation. This will ensure representation across our full diversity of colleagues, and allow the impact of the process to be proactively assessed via reporting in areas such as: gender, ethnicity, contract status and career pathway.\n\n\n\n\nUniversity of Bristol Academic Promotions Framework\n© University of Bristol.

    "text": "A review of promotion and progression in 2017 included recommendations to review the promotion criteria for Associate Professor and Professor, which resulted in a new Academic Promotions Framework (APF) that launched in the 2020-2021 academic year. The APF looks to nurture individual and team excellence through clear descriptions of the full range of contributions and achievements that are valued by our institution. This exercise resulted in the specific inclusion of open research practices as an example of the contributions recognised by the APF.\nThe APF provides four categories for applicants for promotion to demonstrate their achievements against: (1) Research (2) Education (3) Engagement & Impact (4) Leadership & Citizenship. Each has different criteria intended to cover the range of expectations and experiences across academic pathways, and the diversity of staff that work at the University.\nThe Research category captures what it takes to build our position as one of the world’s leading research-intensive universities. Criterion R-1 (Research Outputs) goes beyond just publications and other formal ways of presenting research findings, and explicitly includes open research outputs.\nFor an individual to be recognised for demonstrating open research outputs within the R-1 criterion, they must evidence: ‘Producing open research outputs as appropriate by adopting good practice in, for example, sharing data and code, sharing materials, sharing digital outputs, publishing preprints and pre-registering study protocols’.",

At the same time, our role in UKRN and our long history of sectoral leadership on open research practices meant that the Academic Promotion Framework programme presented an opportunity to embed incentives to promote uptake of these practices.",

    "text": "The Deputy Vice Chancellor and Provost was the senior sponsor of the Academic Promotion Framework programme, and chaired a Programme Board made up of senior stakeholders across the institution. Having a senior sponsor for the change was imperative to promote the strategic importance of creating the APF, and in navigating resistance to the change in the process.\nThe facilitators and Programme Managers of the change were the Academic Staff Development team, operating as part of the Academic Career Development Programme. The University’s commitment to external agreements such as DORA and the Concordat on Open Research Data also established a basis for including open research practices: ‘the production of open research data should be acknowledged formally as a legitimate output of the research process and should be recognised as such by employers… in contributing to an individual’s professional profile in relation to promotion’.\nProfessor Marcus Munafò worked with members of the Programme Board and Academic Staff Development team to argue for the inclusion of open research practices in the Academic Promotions Framework, and developing the corresponding wording.\nThose involved in the Programme Board were:\n\nDeputy Vice-Chancellor and Provost\nChief People Officer\nDirector of People and Organisational Development\nUCU Representatives\nAcademic Representatives (Research, Educational and Leadership Improvement)\nEarly Career Academic Representatives (Post-Doctoral Researcher and Lecturer)\nStaff Engagement Group Representative\nHead of Academic Staff Development\n\nAs the concept and practical resources for the Academic Promotions Framework evolved, there was also significant consultation across the institution for feedback. This included (but was not limited to) the following:\n\nHeads of School across all Faculties\nDeans and Pro Vice Chancellors across all Faculties.\nSchool Managers across all Faculties\nHR Business Partnering and Central HR Operations teams\nEDI Team\nReward and Recognition Teams from Organisational Development\nPeople Development\nTrade Unions\n\nFor the Academic Promotions Framework to be adopted into practice, other changes were required, such as establishing a Faculty Promotions Committee for each Faculty.\nIn particular, narrative writing workshops for building a promotion case within the Academic Promotions Framework were set up to help applicants understand the criteria and how to demonstrate that these had been met. This provided staff with the means and understanding for them to be recognised and rewarded appropriately, via a promotions case, both in general and specifically in relation to the inclusion of open research practices in their case if appropriate.\nIn the development of the Academic Promotion Framework, its concept was shared within the consultation groups (see above). This was via focus groups and bespoke presentations, led by the Academic Career Development Programme.\nThe finalised versions of the Academic Promotions Framework are available to both internal colleagues and externally to the wider public via the University of Bristol website. As the APF versions evolved, this too was updated. The links to the Academic Promotions Framework, and associated guidance documentation were shared via internal bulletins, and by relevant line managers, School and Faculty staff and Heads of HR Business Partnering, as their colleagues prepared their promotion cases.\nThe Academic Promotions Framework launched in time for the 2020/2021 promotions cycle for Associate Professor/Professor grades, and extended to Research/Teaching Associates through to Senior Lecturer/Senior Research Fellow grades in time for the 2021/2022 academic year. Shortly after the launch of the APF, the opportunity to use it to embed incentives for open research practices was recognised and pursued. The open research elements of the Academic Promotions Framework were promoted via the Research Improvement Group and through related activities such as the Open Research Prize.",

This was particularly true for open research practices, which are currently adopted to different degrees across disciplines. Similarly, career stage was a consideration, as earlier-career researchers tend to be more familiar with open research practices than senior researchers.\nPromotion is a topic which intersects several others across the institution. For effective changes to be made to the benefit of individuals and the institutional strategy, there must be meaningful consultation with all those who would be potentially impacted.\nThe iterations that result from this consultation are made most effective when driven by a governance structure with clear accountability and responsibility of roles, working towards clearly defined objectives and timelines.\nThese issues are particularly salient in the context of open research practices, which are variably understood and engaged with across, for example, disciplines and career stage, meaning that the criteria needed to be sufficiently broad and flexible to accommodate this.",

Resources are allocated and supporting resources, systems and processes are well-developed and operating effectively.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHere are suggestions for key actions that can be taken to progress from one level of the maturity framework to the next. These can be considered when you develop an institutional action plan.\n\n\n\nProvide some informal ad hoc support for open research recognition and reward within existing professional services support roles and systems and processes.\n\n\n\n\n\nEnsure that existing open research support roles provide some support for recognition and reward for open research in some defined researcher assessment processes.\nIdentify and develop areas of professional services support and changes to systems and processes necessary to implement recognition and reward for open research.\n\n\n\n\n\nDemonstrate that professional services support for open research has developed, is well-integrated into institutional processes, and is delivering support in alignment with strategic objectives to grow open research culture and practice.\nEnsure that relevant professional services staff have defined and understood responsibilities to support recognition and reward for open research as part of support for responsible research assessment and are delivering effective services.\nEnsure that supporting systems and processes have been developed/implemented as required, are operating effectively, and are delivering timely support in response to demand.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThere is likely to be growing need for both open research and responsible research assessment support as these become more integrated into business as usual and demand increases.\nInstitutions will have some level of existing professional services support for open research. This may be focused on open access research publishing and research data management and sharing. Support may need to define a broader open research remit in accordance with strategic objectives to develop open research culture and practice, and additional staffing/resources may be required or desirable to meet a growing need for training and expert support across a variety of open research practices in addition to publishing and data sharing, e.g. research software engineering and pre-registration, and to provide discipline-specific expertise in open research methods. The senior strategic lead for open research and any relevant stakeholder group should work with professional services to develop strategic plans including business cases for investment where needed, expansion of roles to capture additional open research requirements, creation of partnership models and collaborative relationships, and more effective application of institutional expertise. What is achievable will depend on the avaialbility of resources in the institution.\nThere is likely also to be some existing support for the generation and validation of research metrics, as part of institutional research planning, management and assessment activities, and in response to the needs of individual researchers. Demand for these services can be expected to grow, with greater demand to handle enquiries, provide research metrics reports and researcher profiles, assess/validate metrics on request, and in other ways support those involved in research assessment activities, for example as part of recruitment or promotion panels. Monitoring and reporting on compliance with policy may require additional support. There will also be a need for institutions to work with their academic community to develop responsible assessment processes and provide guidance and training in responsible research assessment.\nThere is work ongoing in the sector to develop indicators and metrics related to open research practices,1 and this may be an area where there will be a need for new responsibilities related to their collection and management. Other new demands may also be established, including training for panels or guidance on job descriptions and narrative CVs.\nColleagues providing support for processes such as recruitment, probation, promotion and performance and development review may need to integrate some support for responsible research assessment, and recognition of open research within that. Additional requirements may be absorbed into existing responsibilities, processes and systems to a large extent. For example, HR staff may need to check job advertisements and job descriptions against requirements; or if there is a requirement for members of recruitment and promotion panels to take training on responsible research assessment, training logs may need to be created and checked. HR colleagues will also need to be sufficiently informed to handle enquiries that may require signposting of relevant policy or information, or making a referral to expert support, for example as provided by open research support colleagues.\n\n\n\nSystems and processes may need to be modified or developed in support of changes to research assessment policies and procedures. For example:\n\nForms may need to be updated, e.g. to include instructions and guidance on citation of open research activities and outputs other than publications where relevant;\nTemplates may need to be updated to include standard texts related to responsible research assessment and open research expectations for use in job advertisements;\nResearch assessment workflows and checklists may need to be developed, to help staff undertake research assessment appropriately. This could include open research-related checks;\nNew systems, or developments to existing systems, and related processes may to be required to collect and process open research information. This is dealt with in more detail below.\n\n\n\n\nDevelopments in research infrastructure are making it easier to identify and collect outputs and data related to individuals and organisations. Information about open research activities and outputs can be used to support institutional planning and development, to manage and report against compliance requirements, and to inform researcher assessments. Institutions may need to adapt existing systems or invest in new solutions and integrate them with their existing research information infrastructure.\nKey developments in research infrastructure directly relevant to capturing and processing information about open research activities and outputs include increasing use of:\n\ntrustworthy repositories to publish and preserve different kinds of outputs;\npersistent identifiers (PIDS) such as DOIs and ORCiDs to enable accurate citation, discovery and linking of entities (e.g. linking of researchers and institutions to research outputs, and linking between research outputs, such as publications and datasets);\nthe CRediT Contributor Roles Taxonomy in output metadata, facilitating more accurate description of individual contributions to research activities and outputs.\n\nPublishers and other providers of research infrastructure services are developing research information and analytics products to enable the aggregation, management and analysis of data about open research outputs (including data, code, protocols, pre-registrations, preprints) and attributes (e.g. CRediT roles) from across a distributed research infrastructure of publisher platforms, repositories, preprint servers, registries, broker services and research information systems. Examples of products that support open research analytics include Dimensions from Digital Science, Elsevier’s Data Monitor, and OpenAIRE Monitor. The PLOS Open Science Indicators initiative, developed in collaboration with the AI company Dataseer, is working to develop and pilot institution-level reporting functionality.2\nOne important aspect for institutions to consider is the openness of research information. It is a principle of responsible research assessment that those being evaluated should be able to verify the data and analysis used to evaluate them. Yet much of the information by which research practices might be monitored and evaluated is held in closed systems. Proprietary commercial products such as Web of Science and Scopus, which underpin much of the publication-based analytics used in researcher assessment activities, lack transparency. This is something that has been of concern to the research assessment reform movement, with DORA, the Leiden Manifesto and CoARA all taking positions in support of open research information. The Barcelona Declaration on Open Research Information, published in 2024, sums up the concerns of the sector and enumerates a set of commitments that signatories can sign up to.\nSome institutions are developing their own workflows and services to collect and manage open research information. For example, the University of Manchester Library has developed an Open Research Tracker, which leverages integrations with its CRIS, CrossRef, and the Scholarcy AI platform to collate and integrate information about publications and data. Its development roadmap anticipates further integrations, including with its data repository, ORCiD, the Open Science Framework, and protocols.io, and the capability to collect data relating to a wider range of output types, including pre-registrations, methodologies, and research software. The University is planning to release its software under an Open Source licence, so that other institutions can make use of it.",

It can be consulted in conjunction with the maturity framework and as part of an institutional self-assessment exercise.\nAn executive summary provides a high-level overview of the context and rationale for strategic action and the main areas of implementation covered by the guide. This is a a useful one-pager for those who want a summary of the essentials.\nThe introductory section, Why recognise and reward open research practice? explains the rationale for strategic action with reference to the wider sector context in more detail. This is a more developed treatment of the subject and can be used by members of a stakeholder group to establish a shared understanding and sense of purpose.\nThe nine sections mapped to the action areas of the maturity framework are designed to enable members of the stakeholder group to develop a more in-depth understanding of the key areas in which action may be required, and to create a practical plan of action to develop institutional maturity.

    "text": "Executive summary\n\nThe importance and benefits of open research are widely accepted. Many institutions explicitly subscribe to open research principles in support of greater transparency and reproducibility. Institutional policies for open access to publications and research data management and sharing are standard and reflect expectations across the sector. Policy drivers and compliance requirements related to open research are set to increase. But institutional commitments and open research policies are relatively unintegrated into research strategy, planning and management, and currently have limited influence on the behaviour of individual researchers. Systems of recognition and reward that operate in the recruitment, probation, promotion and appraisal of researchers can be powerful engines of behavioural change, but at present they do not effectively incentivise or reward open research practice.\nOpen research practices should be a part of how researchers are assessed, because a researcher who uses such practices:\n\nbetter demonstrates, and enables verification of, the quality of their research;\nfacilitates re-use of the products of their research, in this way maximising their potential value and impact;\nis able to provide a more representative picture of their research activities and outputs, enabling a more informed assessment of their capacity as a researcher.\n\nOperationalisation of open research incentives and expectations in the researcher assessment activities of research-performing organisations will signal that open practices are considered to be an essential part of how research is carried out. It will power the adoption of open research practices by researchers and lead to improvements in research integrity, quality and impact. Recognition of open research activities and outputs will also better reflect the collaborative nature of much research, and give more visibility to those who contribute to research, such as data scientists, technicians and research software engineers. This will support a more diverse and inclusive research culture.\nWith momentum for research assessment reform building globally, there is an opportunity to integrate open research into revised researcher assessment frameworks and practices. Since the publication of the San Francisco Declaration on Research Assessment (DORA) in 2013, there has been an evolution in the research assessment reform agenda from an initial focus on responsible use of publication metrics towards a wider responsible research assessment framework. This has entailed increasing attention to elements related to research culture, research integrity and reproducibility, as represented most fully in the Agreement on Reforming Research Assessment published in 2022 by the Coalition for Advancing Research Assessment (CoARA).\nThis broader agenda is shaping the national research assessment framework in the UK as in other countries. The People, Culture and Environment element of the next Research Excellence Framework (REF) will include a greater emphasis on elements of research culture including open research. This is indicative of the direction of travel in the sector towards a more instrumental model of research assessment, which shapes the norms and expectations associated with good research practice. Open research is an integral feature of good research practice as defined by this model.\nInstitutions therefore need to start developing researcher assessment policies to integrate recognition and reward for open research. This work will involve a number of challenges of implementation, which can be characterised at four levels:\n\npolitical: getting buy-in from institutional leaders and managers and key stakeholders in professional services to support policy adoption and implementation across relevant procedures;\ncultural: securing assent from members of the research community in their capacity as both assessors and subjects of research assessment to the inclusion of open research in research assessment, and bringing about changes in practice;\npractical: defining open research in such a way that instances of it can be demonstrated, identified, validated, and qualitatively evaluated within the context of an overall assessment, and providing the training and guidance that enables researchers and assessors to use the criteria effectively;\noperational: implementing the changes to policies and procedures and underpinning systems, processes and support, creating and delivering guidance and training, and monitoring and managing compliance with implemented policies.\n\nThe implementation guide addresses these aspects of implementation, with an emphasis on the political and cultural aspects in the earlier sections moving into the practical and operational aspects in the later sections.",

    "text": "The Recognising and rewarding open research toolkit is designed to help universities and other research-performing organisations implement effective recognition and reward for open research through researcher assessment practices. It can support institutions to develop researcher assessment policies and practices that incentivise, enable and increase the use of open research practices by their researchers.\nThe toolkit has been produced by the Open and Responsible Researcher Reward and Recognition Project (OR4). OR4 is part of the UK Reproducibility Network’s Open Research Programme, which aims to accelerate the uptake of open research practices across the UK Higher Education sector.\nHere’s a quick 7-minute introductory video explaining the toolkit and how to navigate it:\n\n\n\n\nThe toolkit is intended for use by institutional leaders and other stakeholders who are or may be involved in making the case for and implementing recognition and reward for open research within the institution’s researcher assessment processes.\nIt may also be a useful reference for those involved in the management and ongoing operational support of recognition and reward for open research.\n\n\n\nThe toolkit is concerned with introducing appropriate recognition and reward for open research in institutional researcher assessment practices. Activities within scope include the recruitment and probation of researchers, promotion and professorial review, performance and development review, internal funding processes, and any other operations involving the assessment of researchers and groups of researchers. It will also be relevant to institutional research strategy and planning.\nMany research organisations have in recent years embarked on strategic activity to develop open research culture and practice. Many are also considering or engaged in a process of research assessment reform aligned to the principles of responsible research assessment exemplified in the San Francisco Declaration on Research Assessment (DORA) and the Agreement on Reforming Research Assessment. The toolkit sits at the intersection of these two areas. The framework for action presented here supports effective recognition of the diversity of a researcher’s activities and outputs and of open research practice in accordance with the principles of responsible research assessment.\n\n\n\nThe main components of the toolkit are:\n\na maturity framework and self-assessment tool that institutions can use to assess their maturity in the implementation of relevant policies and practices, to support internal discussion and planning, and to measure ongoing progress;\nan implementation guide consisting of an introduction and sections linked to corresponding action areas in the maturity framework, providing detailed practical guidance to support assessment of institutional maturity, planning and progress. The guide is illustrated with case studies that exemplify different aspects of institutional activity.\n\nThe toolkit will continue to evolve throughout the OR4 project (until 2027), as guidance is updated and new case studies are published.\nVisit the toolkit overview to find out more."
